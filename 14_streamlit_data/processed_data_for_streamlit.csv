I added in some chopped mushrooms, minced garlic and an envelope of brown gravy mix. I added Mushroom Ketchup, Red Hot sauce, and Worchester sauce and it was amazing. Also added a tablespoon of Better than Bullion to the glaze. Easy to make My family loves this recipe! The meatloaf is so yummy with the brown-sugar topping. We make meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers! So good! My family loved it and it was so good, but next time I’ll have to make twice the amount of sauce! ps I added onions to the sauce It is a great starting point! I do add Worchestershire, and some garlic. I like the Sweet BBQ sauce, but Trader Joe's has a Sirracha BBQ that is delicious. I add a couple tblsp to the meat mix and the on top. I also use Oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs. Keeps everything moist. Yumm This is the only meatloaf I will ever serve to any guest let alone my family. It never fails to be a crowdpleaser. Sandy Koski I did not make any changes to the recipe and it was delicious. Before thismy meatloaf always fell apart but this one stayed intact. The flavor was good and the texture. Just a good all-around meatloaf recipe. The best!!! My family loves this... I add green and red bell peppers with the onions... I can't eat beef so I make it with ground turkey. I use Worcestershire Sauce, red robbin seasoning. Yum so easy and great tasting We loved this ez recipe and make it often I made this recipe as it was posted. It's easy to make and my kids love it. It's a simple meatloaf with a tangy sauce on top. It's definitely a keeper! I just made it today. Delicious . I did not do the onion and I only put 1/3 of the sauce ( I feel that if people want more they can have it on the side ) So easy and so delicious. I loved it ! I used crushed instant noodles instead of bread crumbs and spicy mustard instead of regular and onion powder instead of onions. Worked out great ! I use your recipe w some changes. I make 2 bowls of the topping. I add 1 bowl for the ground pork/hamburger mix that I make and 1 bowl for topping. I add less milk than called for in recipe. And I use a mix of Panko crumbs and bread crumbs. I use light brown sugar, not dark. It turns out fabulous every time. I get many compliments on it. Thank you for your recipe. Good. But you do need to add your own spices. I used parsley and basil, etc. sweet onion. and a bit of garlic fresh. Instead of bread crumbs can try it with dry oatmeal. That will work too. Enjoy! This recipe was not good. I had to add seasonings: garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, little chili powder, Italian bread crumbs, onions, mushrooms, green peppers, Lawry’s, season, Adobo, little sofrito … then make the topping add more seasonings for flavor….. However, it was easy. Delicious!!! And I love how easy it is to make, I'm an old geezer, 67 to be exact and this recipe was easy, even for me! My other says i should have been a gourmet chef! Whatever! Prep bake and taste all get two thumbs up! Just like Mom made back in the day, and so easy. Loved the sauce. As others have mentioned, it lends itself to your favorite little additions, like worcestershhire, bacon, etc. I had a couple of leftover slices of ham I diced up and threw in, yum! P. S. I didn't have an onion, but a tablespoon of onion powder worked great. I always use this recipe. I usually top it with bar b q sauce and place some bacon stripes over top. Everyone who has tried my meatloaf loves it. It also makes great sandwiches from the left over, if there are any. This was my first ever meatloaf and I used this recipe with great results! I thought it came out *surprisingly* tasty (I made it, after all) and my partner absolutely loved it. The one thing I added off-recipe was a half-packet of onion soup/dip mix -- yum! Super easy to make and easily customizable. I eye-balled measurements except for milk, which I measured and nearly forgot to add! Went with a little less mustard than called for. Substituted with saltine crackers (breadcrumbs) and onion soup mix (onion). Seasoned with seasoned salt, black pepper, and garlic powder until it felt right. 🤣 Very good! I make this, but definetly tweak it a bit. I add about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, about 3-4tbsp of ketchup, 3-4 tbsp of mustard and no onion. My family loves it! My microwave meatloaf is much easier and delicious. It is super good that I just want to make it every night. This was my first time cooking something from a recipe (real food/not frozen) by myself. It took longer than I realized, but I was being very thorough taking my time and triple checking everything. The pan I had made it a little thin per the amount of ingredients but it turned out PERFECT for my first time. Definitely making it again. This is my go-to for meat loaf. Simple to make with staples you probably already have. Simple, quick and very flavorful. This is actually the second time I made it ! I tweaked the ingredients because the mustard is strong. I also added more ketchup as well. 1/2 cup ketchup and 1tbsp mustard. Tastes fire when it's all done ! Great recipe!! Made it last nite with a few tweaks. I omitted the milk, added brown mustard and bell peppers. Didn't use the brown sugar on topping. It was the best meatloaf I've made. Next time will Sautee the bell pepper tho. Thanks allrecipies. Holy harsh comments. I used crushed salted tops added the milk, then added to the meat. So it's no so liquidity like everyone saying it is. Only half cooked so far but still looks good. Add the glaze when it's cooked a bit first. Yum I made this exactly as written and found it to be delicious! Thanks for the easy recipe! Way too soupy. Need to cut the milk down. I added a bunch of spices. Flavor was good consistency was not so great. Sauce topping was good. I used less brown sugar and stone ground mustard with the ketchup. Great for busy parents. Easy and filling. I made this recipe and added my own razzle dazzle. I started by using a can of homestyle chicken noodle soup. You know what I’m talking about ladies, the best Campbells chicken noodle. I put that on a pan and let it get steamy hot and then I ate it. So good, like mm’ good!!! Definitely would do it again. It tasted quite good but it was very very watery for some reason. I added everything it asked me to, so this was a confusing outcome. The sauce was good but n the meatloaf was moist but it tasted very plain. One cup of milk is WAY too much for this recipe. I love this meatloaf and make it a few times a year... But be careful with the milk. Start with a quarter cup. Also, I saute my onions first because in the past they were crunchy and not softened during the baking. A simple recipe with a great taste! I will be making it again and again! I used 1 lb gr. beef and 1/2 lb pork sausage; added bell pepper and went with crackers in lieu of bread crumbs. Even cold leftovrs, were delicious as a sandwich the next day! I sauté a cup of celery and the onion before adding to the meat mixture. Also, a sprinkle of sage. Yummy meatloaf. Best meatloaf I've made. Always rave reviews when I've made it for others, too. I always use the leanest ground beef to cut down on grease and shrinkage when cooked. SUPER easy and quick too. I used panko crumbs, worked well. Family favorite! My family lol oved this! I used Italian bread crumbs, added extra onion, fresh bell pepper from my garden,and tsp of minced garlic. For the topping I used my favorite bbq sauce from purewhitetail.com instead. It's a bit smokey, a bit sweet and a bit spicy but not hot. I loved it! Did make some changes though. I used 2 pounds of beef, 2 eggs, 1.5 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, lots of garlic powder, paprika, basil, thyme, onion powder. Delicious!!!! no only added russian dressing to meatloaf mixture. it gives it a great taste Delicious and easy. Our absolute favourite recipe. We use Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs and add mixed herbs to add flavour. We also fry the onion until soft. Makes the most flavoursome, moist and delicious Meatloaf. My mother gave me this recipe 70 years ago,. There two differences, per her original recipe: add 1 package/envelope of dry Onion Soup mix, and BBQ sauce rather than ketchup. Loved this! Only had a pound of ground chuck so decreased the other items a bit and also followed the oatmeal substitution for the bread (gluten free). Meatloaf is not my favorite dish but honest to gosh, this was outstanding! Loved it! And so did my picky husband! Thank you! I make it exactly as specified except I double the quantity of sauce. And I cook it for 90 minutes as 60 minutes is not long enough. My family loves it Super great base recipe! I added a lot more spices and tweaked the sauce a little. Tried to go for seconds, but was way too full. Will be making this again! Very easy to make and taste great Simple quick easy and delicious This makes a great meatloaf BUT, use oatmeal instead of bread crumbs or crackers. Oatmeal keeps it moist, not dry. (also healthier) Love this it's easy to Dinner tonite. I love this recipe! It's easy and delicious. I don't like peppers or ""extra"" stuff in my meatloaf - just a good old fashion recipe. My mom makes this (she's 83) and now my aunt makes it too. I do use a meatloaf mix of beef, pork and veal. It was simple and quick. I loved it. I added green peppers and used honey BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. It turned out great. This is a great starter recipe. I added Worcestershire sauce to mine. Turned out amazing. So easy to prepare. And taste and texture is terrific. Reminds me of my Great Aunts recipe. Made this for the wife, it's the only way she wants it now. Nothing else compares. It was delicious and so easy to make Like my mom used to make. Great recipe! Easy to prepare. The directions are easy to follow and produce a great meatloaf. Wonderful flavor and texture! This was a real simple meatloaf that had great flavor , I enjoyed very much .. I have always been disappointed in homemade meatloaf so I approached this ready to be disappointed again. And holy crap, it was so good I really wanted a second helping but I stopped myself so that I could have even more the next day. This is A-mazing!!! A family favorite Receipt is really good overall For lack of some ingredients I mixed tomato paste, water and a little maple syrup for the topping. Very moist and I was pleasantly surprised. Fantastic Meatloaf Every Time! My family Loves it  I don’t mind making it. So easy  tastes Great! Sandwiches are so good! ❤️ Love this recipe. I add bbq sauce n gouda in the middle. I take out the brown sugar and mustard as ketchup is sweet enough. I add a tbs of worcheisisisisisierrrrrrrrrr sauce to it and a tad bit more italian seasonin to it. The wor sauce n ital seas i blend into the meat. Never had a complaint and always gets maxed when done. Gave this a try to change up the Thanksgiving dinner this year. We added a layer of smoked gouda through the middle of the loaf and with the sauce it was just wonderful. Will definitely make again. It was ok. Remove some the mustard and only half a onion. It was a big joke in my house regarding the fact that I was unable to make a decent meatloaf. Have used this recipe several times and finally it is a big hit. Great recipe! Sooooo gooooood! Thanks for the recipe! This will be made a lot! ( I used crackers, and dehydrated onions because I didn’t have fresh, but otherwise kept it original) Very easy very good I really like the sauce on top !!! Yummy I really like this meatloaf recipe. I only had Italian breadcrumbs on hand so that's what I used. I don't like a strong mustard taste so I just used small amount of mustard for the sauce and the topping was excellent. This recipe was really good. I didn’t have ketchup or fry mustard so I subbed bbq sauce and yellow mustard. I also added cooked chopped bacon. I also made a mistake and added all the ingredients together then topped with more bbq sauce. The results were amazing Fantastic recipe to begin with , however I used Italian bread crumbs and stone ground mustard this time, which changed my whole thoughts on “ oh meatloaf again “ as a kid Brian I added California garlic powder. Best meatloaf I’ve ever made. I did use cracker crumbs. Tested the temp, @155-160 removed it. Didn’t take an hour. 2022-09-20 - Jude made this... Well, I dunno. I've never made meatloaf and neither did my mom so I am unfamiliar with how it is supposed to turn out. But there was about 1/2 to 3/4 cup liquid and grease in the pan when it was done. Mainly liquid, not as much grease as I had expected. The liquid seems excessive, but maybe that's normal? Like I said, I am ignorance itself when it comes to meatloaf, but 1 cup milk seemed like a lot? I did my best to drain the liquid, with little success. We'll see how the leftovers turn out. BTW, ""salt and pepper to taste"" drives me crazy. If I knew how much to put in, would I need a recipe? So I just guessed. 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp pepper. It could probably use a bit more salt, but the pepper was fine. I would have given 5 stars, but for the excessive liquid. We added bell pepper and it was so good! Didn't have breadcrumbs, used Life Cereal instead. Mixed cereal into crumbs using Ninja. Look good. Added dry mustard to meat also and 1/3 cup BBQ sauce. Used onion powder, no fresh onion. For glaze added 1/3 BBQ and 1/3 cup ketchup to mix. It makes a lot more meatloaf than it says. Fed family of 5 easy, 2 are teenaged boys. Really easy to make. Tasted really good. The BBQ added a southern flair to the loaf. Yes a little bit of changes to make it larger Good basic recipe for meatloaf. I had a 2lb package of hamburger so I used it all and it required about 10 extra minutes to cook. I used all the other ingredients as written in the recipe but would probably add to it as others have mentioned. I didn’t like the sweetness of the topping and will leave the brown sugar out next time. I look forward to the cold meatloaf sandwich I’ll make with the leftovers! Made no changes it was Delicious Fantastic meatloaf makes great sandwiches the day after! So easy! The only meatloaf recipe I use. I do make more tipping, using less brown sugar than recipe states. Monday night meatloaf is a real thing now. I use a couple of different variations of this recipe. I havent used worcestershire before but might try it today. I use homemade chicken stock instead of milk. To make my meatloaf one of a kind I used golden mushroom soup in the mixture and on top. I saute my onions until they have just bit of color. Today I am going to use 1 1/2 lbs of extra lean ground beef and 1/4 lb of sweet Italian sausage. yum A little too sweet for my taste. Easy to make though. Excellent recipe my entire family loved it About (1999) I had a recipe card for this and lost it. Since, I've tried different recipes but ONLY this one stands! This meatloaf hooked my boyfriend at the time =] We've now been together 23 years (2022) hee, hee. Absolutely delicious!! Thanks! My husband also thanks you! Excellent recipe! I added Worcester, thyme, Montreal steak seasoning, chopped yellow pepper and celery. Very wet. The meatloaf turns out to just be mush. Even tried cooking it a half hour longer and increasing the temperature and pouring out all the liquid halfway through I mix the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar in with the meatloaf instead of pouring it on top. This recipe is so easy and very satisfying. I did add half of a yellow bell pepper. I will definitely be making it again. Served with Mac cheese and bacon wrapped asparagus ",1,19.5

All I added was mushrooms. Poured the gravy over baked potatoes. So good!! The recipe is perfect as it is. Do not add the ketchup unless you like ketchup burgers or are feeding kids. Might can be tweaked, but is overpowered by the ketchup. Can't taste the salisbury flavor. Will not do as written again. We have a good recipe, this just looked easier. Always a family favorite! My family’s favorite thing I make I am not sure what everyone is talking about. Most of the sauce is French onion soup, if you don't like the flavor, it is probably the soup, try another. The ketchup and mustard are a small part of that flavor. It was just not good. Mustard and ketchup did not work. As always, I make it as is before tweaking a recipe! But I definitely agree with making of more gravy, at least doubling it!! I also add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the gravy as well. The ketchup wasn't necessary in recipe, made it taste too much like tomatoes. I will use this recipe again without ketchup next time. The sauce made it taste more like meatloaf.... Delicious! Made this recipe tonight. The steaks stayed together in the pan. I was so excited! I love all recipes I’ve made this for years, thanks Mom! Like another reader my version subs Lipton soup mix packet - Half in the mince half in the gravy. Also recommend skipping the catsup for 1 heaping tbsp of tomato paste. Less sweet, more savory. Excellent and easy! Followed directions exactly and the results were perfect. Will definitely make again. I'm sorry that this was not a win in my house. I thought it was OK, but the sauce is too tangy and sweet from too much ketchup. My daughter didn't like the texture of the meat; I think it had too many bread crumbs. Also, with the way it cooked, there was lots of grease for me to try to drain off before serving. I won't be trying this one again. My kids are super picky eaters, but THEY LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!! So much that I make a double batch each time now because they always want more. I usually serve it with rice and drizzle the sauce on the rice too or with fettuccine alfredo, along with a veggie. My family loves this recipe. I always make sure that I have the ingredients in the pantry and beef I. The freezer as this is a recipe I go to when I can’t decide what to make for dinner. Great meal with mashed potatoes and locally grown sweet corn. I love this recipe. It is easy to make and turns out a delicious dinner. The gravy is especially good. This recipe is delicious just as written. I made it a few times for my family and they absolutely loved 🥰 it. Everyone asks me for the recipe, the only thing I do differently is add more onion soup to the mix to make extra gravy, everybody wants the gravy. Thank you. Winner for us. This is a wonderful, tangy make again recipe that we all loved! I had no canned onion soup so i used a packet of dried onion soup in the burger with about 2 cups water to rehydrate the onions. Next time i would go a little less on the water as the burgers were a little soupy to start but did cook down well. I left out the salt due to the onion soup being salty. I doubled the entire gravy recipe using another whole packet of onion soup mix in that with about 3 cups of hot water in that, maybe more. I also upped the flour an extra tbl (a generous 3 total)to help thicken it and it was perfect! It was a big hit all the way around, especially served over mashed potatoes :} So the 1st time I made this I forgot to grab French onion soup. So I had used lipton onion soup powdered mix. Made it with 1/2 the amount of water it calls for and went with it. I also completely forgot to add the worcestershire sauce. 😬 let me tell you. That was SALISBURY STEAKS on point. It was delicious!!!! 2nd time around, we decided to follow the recipe, and it just was not it. It was super sweet and you can definitely taste the worcestershire in the gravy. It was a HUGE hit the 1st time with the accidents and replacements. I hope someone tries this and it works for them! I made this as is. No substitutions. I liked it. It does make 6 ""steaks"" so it definitely makes a bunch :) I would make again. Very good first time made it I had this recipe cut from a newspaper for years, but moved too many times and lost it. Voilà, I can always go to Allrecipes and find what I need. We love the French onion soup/ketchup, etc taste, and it just tastes so good over a hamburger pattie; however…just kidding. It all is good! I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I doubled the gravy ingredients except for the ketchup, and added cream of mushroom and dry onion soup. Instead of mustard powder, I added 1 tbsp mustard. Served with mashed potatoes and it was sooo good Followed the recipes exactly. My family loved it! 5 stars as husband loves it. He says it takes very similar to his mom's meatloaf. Easy to prepare and cook and I always have these ingredients on hand. A definite keeper in my binder! Thank you for sharing. My ONLY 'go to' recipe when we want Salisbury steaks for dinner ... Since the gravy 'thickens' some while cooking, I 'double' the seasonings (tripling the soup - minus the 1/3 can for meat mixture) to make EXTRA sauce for mashed potatoes or the RARE chance there are any leftovers ... which is NOT very often! :) AWESOME for 'dinner' the next morning {LOL!} ... I am a night shift nurse  don't always want 'breakfast' food when I come home hungry. :-P It was easy to make , very good This recipe is perfect! I did triple the gravy part so we would have more to put over the steak. OMG! This was good! It's so AWESOME!🤗 Turned out exactly how I imagined it would taste!!! I loved this recipe my husband said it’s better than his mom’s meatloaf recipe and that’s saying a lot. I did make a couple changes. I added chopped onion and garlic to the meat mixture and a little extra bread crumbs. I browned in a frying pan but cooked the rest of the way in the oven with the sauce on top (325 for 30 minutes). My stove top and I don’t get along and they would be hockey pucks if I cooked all the way in the stove top. I doubled the sauce so there would be extra for potatoes. Amazing, turned out so juicy and tender. Came out perfect. We loved it. I did it exactly like the recipe said, step-by-step, and it was delicious. I think everyone tweaks recipes according to personal taste, so I'm not criticizing - add what you like, remove what you don't. This was excellent!! I wanted to ""lick my plate""! Very good! Easy to make. Double the sauce for gravy over mashies! Wish I read the comments before making this. Soup? Ketchup? Mustard? Yikes. My kid is not happy and she’s obsessed with those gross microwave Salisbury steaks…so I thought she’d love homemade. Not this one! Trying a different recipe next time. Loved it Love this recipe! It's easy and delicious! Made as instructed. Family truly enjoyed it. Next time I’ll make the “ onion soup” / stock. Can soup was salty. Added mushrooms to sauce. Served with roasted cauliflower-yum all around!!! Thank you When I make a dish for the first time, I always follow the recipe exactly. I loved it! I will double the sauce next time just to cover the mashed potatoes too. Great recipe! one of those great tasting low effort. My steaks held together. i packed it by tossing them hard into my hands a couple of times. I didn't have dry mustard, so i used a squirt of dijon. otherwise followed the recipe. very tasty and easy. This is my go to.. Very simple and I have yet to be disappointed.. This time through I used Ground Turkey.. Again not disappointed! I made this, the meat is very good but the gravy is not. I've been eating Salisbury steak all my life and the gravy does not taste anything like any other Salisbury 
Steak gravy I have ever had. Doesn't taste like mom used to make. If I was going to make it again I would leave out the mustard and the Worcestershire sauce, I thought that was strange when making it. I will make the meat recipe again but not the gravy. Good luck...! This is an ok meal but it is definitely not like any Salisbury steak I have eaten. I would label this as a “meatloaf medallion” recipe. The steaks need more of a binding agent and the gravy is not brown gravy but like a meatloaf glaze. Really good! No adjustments other than the number of servings. I've been making this recipe for quite some time now. I find that it's delicious. I always make recipes as written at least the first couple of times the only thing I change in this recipe is that I don't find you need the additional salt. The French onion soup adds enough saltiness to the dish. I think the ketchup almost gives it a sweet and sour taste with the vinegar base to it. This is on my regular regimen of recipes to use for quick easy after work go to dinner. This was a great dish. Very flavorful and easy to make. Dee-Lishous! I just added a touch more of the seasonings  Worcestershire sauce. I had run out of flour so I used the pancake flour I had. Made with sautéed broccoli and long grain wild rice. This is one of our regulars. Sometimes we make it exactly as the recipe states except no ketchup and we only use venison burger. We always do it with homemade mashed potatoes. Sometimes I use Onion soup mix instead of the soup called for. I normally double the sauce as we love it. Its a great recipe to build on or leave just as is. My adult grandson, our caregiver and cook made this for supper. He used some of the modifications suggested. However, when he went to add the bread crumbs, he realized he had forgotten to pick them up at the grocery. At dinner he asked how we liked his secret ingredient. I had noticed bits of orange and thought he had finely chopped up some carrot in the meat. When I questioned what the secret ingredient was, he told us he used Goldfish cheddar crackers crushed for the bread crumbs. Thus the bits of orange and other colors flecks in the meat. We had a huge laugh and a truly delicious meal. Goldfish crackers to the rescue! Absolutely delicious! Much better than the frozen kind. The only thing I will change next time is to double the sauce. Working from home affords me the time to make sure my family has something good to eat when our busy day starts winding down. This is one of not only their favorites but one of mine. Its absolutely delicious and very simple to make. I usually make a little extra of the sauce as its wonderful on mashed potatoes and everyone love to smother their steak in it. Delicious, love this recipe! A new family favorite! I took one of the other cooks suggestion and put it in the oven at 375 for 40 mins. and it came out perfect. It was better than any Salisbury Steak that I have ever had. Made this but the cook time was a little log. We like our burgers MED. I will cook in less time next time.. This recipe I first saw many many years ago on this website. I tweak it here and there like using meatloaf mix meat (pork, veal, beef) and make a ton more gravy and serve over egg noodles but that's about it. I've tried other recipes but always come back to this one-my favorite! LOVE IT!!! Excellent dish! my family loved it I triple the sauce because my family likes it so well and it goes great on open faced sandwiches the next day All the thumbs up from the boys. I used a dry onion soup mix and 1/3 cup of half and half that I had in the fridge instead of the condensed soup. Added sliced baby Bella mushrooms because they are so good. Would be amazing with mashed potatoes. This is going to sound crazy but but as usual, I didn't read through the whole recipe before I started. I'm always in such a hurry. I ended up dumping all of the ingredients in with the hamburger meat. Oh well, they came out perfectly. Fabulous taste actually. Once the patties were browned I removed them from the pan,added in a jar of sliced mushrooms, sauteed them for a moment or 2, then added in a Brown gravy from a packet then re introduced the patties to the pan and let them simmer for a few moments ,served over mashed potatoes. Perfection . Sorry I totally bastardized your recipe but it was still great. thank you. I didn't have any French Onion soup, so I diced up some onion and used Better Than Bouillon to make the broth. Loved the gravy too! Definitely making this again! Never again! This feel apart while cooking it. My husband loves this! Followed recipe 100% and will not ever change it. Perfect as is! TYVM for sharing such a delicious one. I added the cream of mushroom soup and mushrooms but I did not like the ketchup in the recipe. It made it too sweet and I am not a huge fan of sweet hot food This was simple and easy to make. Just enough flavor as not to overpower. Added some pan fried onions and mushrooms thrilled my parents.
The extra meat made fantastic burgers! My family loved this!!! The meat and the gravy were delicious. We like mushrooms so I added a couple of cans of diced mushrooms to the gravy. This is now a family fav. This turned out amazing! I did like other reviewers and omitted the salt, doubled the gravy recipe—everything except the ketchup, left that the same and added cream of mushroom and Lipton beef and onion powder soup mix! Browned patties and transferred to a single use aluminum pan on 375 for 35 minutes. Cooked up wonderfully! Definitely will be making these again! Thank y’all! I WANTED TO SURPRISE MY HUSBAND WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHEN HE CAME HOME LATE AT NIGHT. WOW!! HE WAS SO HAPPY HE DIDN'T HAVE WORDS THE NEXT DAY, OTHER THAN, THAT WAS GREAT THANK YOU HONEY!! MY DAUGHTER AGE 10, TOLD ME MOM THIS WAS GOOD WHAT IS IN IT?? I SAID, SHHHHH IT IS A SECRET AND I CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING A TOUCH OF YOUR FAMILY HISTORY WITH ME!! Love this recipe and my family does too ! Made it to exact specifications but doubled the gravy .Served it with mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce. I followed the recommendations of others. Cut the ketchup in half. Augmented the gravy with one pkg Lipton Onion Soup Mix, 1 tbsp flour and 1cup of water. Cooked up beautifully and is now a favorite! Thanks to the catchup in the recipe it tasted a lot like meatloaf to me. Very good! This was delicious! We had to substitute the condensed soup because we didn’t have any, so we used 1 package of onion soup mix and beef broth. So good. We read other reviews and made extra sauce since we had to use 2 lbs of meat. Had this with egg noodles and peas. And we can freeze 2 meals (there is just hubby and me). After reading other recipes, I also refrigerated the patties for 20 minutes to firm them up so they didn’t break apart when browning. What a great surprise! I've only had the Banquet frozen salisbury steak and after making this one I'll never go back. The only change I made was like some other reviewers I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and baked in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. Like alot of the others I served this with mashed potatoes and chuck wagon corn (frozen corn with onions bell peppers purchased at Stater Bros) My wife has loved this since the first time I made it!!! She’ll ask for it at least once a month  FYI: if you replace the flour  bread crumbs with Gluten Free items it still tastes amazing!!!! Our family loves this dish!!! My family loves this recipe! Not a scrap left! Made this for the guys at the fire house and it went over very well. The next time I make it I'll probably buy more cans of French Onion soup or some packets of brown gravy in place of the ketchup/flour/etc mix. Since I made so many (4lbs worth) I had to bake them in 2 pans at 400 for about 40 minutes. Love this so good thank u I made this recipie, without changing anything. And I found it to be quite delicious. After reading some of the comments, I was afraid that it was going to be bland. It wasn't. So im making it again for a second time. Came out Awesome!!! Added a bunch of garlic. My family loved it and easy to make. Making it again!!! My family really enjoyed this! I always read several comments before making recipes, and make changes that have been recommended by many... These are the changes I made: I added a minced onion and garlic to the meat before forming the patties. I added a can of COM, omitted the ketchup and added about half of a brown gravy packet to the sauce. Lastly, I transferred the browned patties to a casserole dish, poured the gravy over them and baked in the 375 degree oven for 30 min. Easy and tasty...served with smashed potatoes and green beans. I have made this recipe at least a dozen times now. My family loves it just the way it is and the “steak” is unbelievably tender and juicy. A great winter hearty meal! loved the recipe..and made no changes I have to agree with the comments on the sauce. Tangy tasting. Would be better with gravy based sauce. YUM I added whole mushrooms for my husband served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I LOVE this recipe. It’s delicious and easy. After several times of making it I do as an additional fresh sliced onion, because how can you not have more onion?!? Cheers! It was my first attempt at making Salisbury Steak and it came out delicious. Great recipe. I was out of worcesteshire subbed soy sauce. Topped with mushrooms as we happen to like them. Perfect. Quick, easy, headache free on a weeknight. Overall, pretty solid. I would suggest lowering the cook time and/or heat when cooking covered. And also save some gravy for serving make more than what the recipe calls for. easy to make great flavor. Wife loved it. Definitely delicious! I have also substituted the French onion dry mix and beef broth when I didn’t have French onion soup. Still tasty! Husband and toddler love it as well! Very good. Only thing different I would do is make more gravy to go with it. The recipe ""as is"" is a really good starting point. I followed Allyson Hester's recommendations in her review and created a delicious, tasty meal with enough gravy to use on our mashed potatoes. Next time I might add onions to the steaks. This recipe is going into my meal rotation! Was really amazing! I loved it. Though I substituted the condensed French onion soup with the powder mixed French onion soup. And increased the remaining ingredients for extra gravy! Quick, easy and hearty! ",0,25.333333333333332

I used bacon fat instead of olive oil and added the bacon for extra flavor. Rave reviews from my family. My husband is from Louisiana and liked it very much. Made it exactly as the recipe. It's a keeper. Tastes just like my evil ex step Mother Terri made it. She is a horrible person at heart but made the best southern dishes. I ate the whole lot of it. Added cayenne and red pepper for that ""OOOHHH YEAHHH"" I use this recipe as a sort of template. In a nod to Kermit Ruffins I use what he mentions is his secret weapon-I cook the beans with smoked neck bone. Adds some nice smoky flavor. I also use chicken stock instead of water. Otherwise, pretty much the rest is this recipe I strayed from the instructions a little but kept to the seasoning. I cooked everything in a crockpot after soaking beans overnight. I am high elevation in Utah so it took 9 hours. I also added whole grain brown rice to the beans after the first 4 hours instead of cooking white rice separately; and shredded chicken instead of sausage. Easy, minimal dishes and delicious. The seasonings are amazing, the taste is the best. I can't wait for leftovers. This is a basic ""how you cook dry beans"" recipe, so the complaints of the beans not cooking are not the fault of the recipe, but the faults of the cooks. I made as directed, except: I am lazy about washing dishes. There is no reason to brown the vegetables in a separate skillet. Brown them first in the pot you are cooking the beans in. Then add the beans. Cook as directed. I also didn't brown the sausage in a separate pan. The sausage cooks in the hot beans. I thought this recipe was very delicious (it did need salt though) . I will definitely be making this dish again. Thanks 😊 I did alter the recipe a little. First off I live at altitude, Colorado to be specific and here they take much longer to make and get soft. They take all day. This should be explained in the recipe. Altitude makes a difference in cooking people. Secondly I have made red beans and rice before and have learned that they taste better if while they are cooking you add either smoked ham hock or smoked turkey leg. It adds so much flavor to the dish. So I made this and tasted it halfway in between of cooking and it was so bland , so I definitely added more of my own seasoning and also very watery so I had to make my own Roux to thicken it up. So with that It was a great starter recipe. Definitely add your own extra seasonings and have fun with it! I regularly make a modified version of this dish (not using the sausage and using smoked paprika to add the smoky flavour, as well as larger pinches of all the spices) and I've always found it pretty delicious and good for frozen mealprep! I tend to use the stockpot after I've cooked the kidney beans and browned the vegetables, which works pretty well. Easy to make a lot for my family. I've made this multiple times and it's been a hit every single time. Great recipe1 I made this as directed. The first problem was after 45 minutes on the stove I had to add two cups of water to prevent it from burning. In all, in the 3 hours it was cooking, I added 7 cups of water. The second problem was the beans never fully cooked. After soaking them for more than 24 hours and cooking them for 3 hours total, they still weren't done. I tried cooking them for 15 minutes more but ended up picking the sausage out and throwing them into a pressure cooker for 20 minutes and added another cup of water. Third, after putting the sausage back in the beans, I tasted it and it had absolutely no flavor. I had to add 3 more teaspoons of Creole seasoning to finally make it palatable. As someone getting into cooking more for themself, this recipe was fantastic! Left me with many more servings and tasted absolutely fantastic, with the perfect hint of spice and umami. I would definitely make this again. I had a large batch of Boudin in the fridge, since it also has rice in it, I added a number of them to the gumbo instead of worrying about rice. Made sure I had the celery, onions, green peppers nicely sautéed, added in some hot hatch peppers just for the flavor and spice, Andouille was there, nicely sauteed with the Boudin. I thought I would add a chicken breast or thigh, but looked like a lot of meat with my beans so decided this time I would leave it out. Didn't have any shrimp, so maybe next time. I did add some Gumbo Filet, added at the end and a number of other spices as I went along. My red beans, not Kidneys, soaked overnight. My husband was born in Bogalusa, LA. I have been given thumbs up! Oh, almost forgot, cornbread in the cast iron skillet in the oven, fried potatoes with onions and other stuff. Put on a small skillet of greens, just for another side. Just the two of us, but going to be eating it for about a month. Just joking. Freezer works just fine. Okay, too much water, no salt...I did after it a bit. I tried to boil off some of the water; mashed the bean to thicken it; added a tsp of salt, a Goya chicken bouillon cube, a tsp of gumbo file, a tsp of creole seasoning, and beef hillshire hot links, because that's all I had. And I cooked a pot of Thailand rice. Now, the end result: Amazing, could have used a little more salt, and maybe some Louisiana hot sauce, but, for NJ, I'll take it. And for that, and the base of this recipe, I'll give it a five, because that bowl right there, it didn't even make it to the table. I have 3 grown sons and a husband, it won't last into the night. Made exactly to recipe and it was amazing!! Even served some to my friend from Louisiana who has a Creole grandfather and she fished over it and asked for seconds! OH MY! This recipe is a keeper! I used jasmine rice. It was absolutely delicious! I like to top my beans and rice with chopped tomatoes, raw onions, and jalapeños. I ate it for breakfast AND lunch the next day!!! Yummmy!!!! Thank you! I love this recipe. I followed the recipe word for word and used Silva Louisiana Hot Links which boosted the flavor and let me tell you! It was delicious definitely will be making again Made this for the first time and it was amazing! I started late making the recipe so I followed the quick soak for kidney beans and covered the beans while they cooked. The recipe calls for 3 hours of cooking and mine was fine in 2 hours. I think covering it helps keep the flavors together and it cooks faster. I cooked it in 6 cups of chicken broth for more flavor. For the sausage I used a mix of andouille and smoked beef sausage. I also added an extra teaspoon of Cajun seasoning and no cayenne. Otherwise, followed it to a T and it was delicious!! I think I would pass the test with “Hold the Mayo” on twitter. 😂 I added a lil' smoked paprika to it also. Great recipe. But instead of the recommended sausage I used Conecuh sausage whoo weeee!!!!!!! delicious...I did not have onions or garlic so I used green pepper jalapeno carrot celery with garlic salt and garlic and onion powder, slap ur mama, cajun seasoning, creole seasoning, thyme, sage, bay leaf, ham hock, with rice vinegar and brown sugar then some white wine, lawry and magi seasonings with tabasco. red beans and I had left over black beans so I threw that in and I went back for a second bowl...went nicely with sweet tea. I prefere it with bacon and saute onions and garlic in that grease then add in with ham hock had much flavoring to me. Used chicken broth instead of water. Polish sausage worked well for me. Simple. I put it in my instant pot for 30 minutes instead. Mind blown! I soaked my beans for six hours in cold water and added chicken bouillon to my veggies during the sautee. I used seven cups of water and during my initial taste test, added an additional cup. The gravy was perfection and went great with brown rice. My fiancee and I both went back for seconds! Will definitely make this dish again! Great basic recipe... I added chopped Tasso to the sausage and sauteed it first in some bacon fat, removed and cooked the Vegetables in the rendered fat...1/2 chicken stock 1/2 water, delicious. I grew up eating these in Louisiana, though I never obtained a recipe. This is just how I remember them! I do prefer the actual 'Red Bean' to the kidney bean. They are half the size. If you cannot find them dried, you can use canned. They are usually found over by the chili beans. You can substitute other sausages as well without sacrificing flavor. And thank you to the reviewer who said these were typically served as a meal on Mondays. My husband didn't believe me. I used pinto beans instead of red beans, simply because the store was out of dried red beans the day I was shopping for this. It made no difference, the beans were terrific. I also boil the beans after soaking them and throw in about a tablespoon of baking soda, then drain and rinse them before I use them. This reduces the gas factor in the beans. If you do this, watch the beans because they'll foam up and overflow the pot if you're not careful. It is amazing I give it 4 stars only bc I give nothing 5 stars. I added Green onions as well as Louisiana Cajun Swamp Hot Sauce and Tasso.🔥😎❤️ This is the one! So authentic, I could almost hear a zydeco band while it was cooking! The taste was exactly like it should be. Thank you, Miami Beach, for the recipe. Although I’m not from Louisiana , this dish is lacking in flavour. It need needs salt and more spices. Very disappointed in this dish sorry but probably won’t make it again. I've attempted this twice now and it just doesn't work. Both times I've had to keep adding water as it doesn't say to cover and without a cover it just cooks off without cooking the beans all the way. Flavor is great, but cooking and timing is not working. Good starter recipe to experiment with. Added 3 bullion cubes to the water and a can of diced tomatoes, juice drained. As well as a smoked ham hock while it cooked. ….and because we’re TexMex country here, always fresh cilantro. Add a chicken bullion cube to the rice. Excellent! YUM!! I used the rapid soak method for my beans. A couple tips: I used a Dutch oven pan and browned the sliced andouille sausage in the oil first then removed it from the pan to cook the veggies in that flavorful oil. If you want a thicker sauce, cook it towards the end with the lid off. I smashed some of the beans at the end to give it more creaminess. And if you add salt, do it at the END to avoid raising the temp of the liquid so the beans can soften up easier while cooking. I personally thought it needed some salt to bring those flavors out more. We served over rice with bits of green onion on top, a salad, and homemade cornbread. Delish!! I grew up in the heart of N’awlins, only knowing cooking from Creole and Cajun grandparents. I give this recipe 2 thumbs up, and 5 stars! This is by far the best recipe! Really simple to make, reminds me of my grandmother's and mother's versions in Louisiana. Do check your spices before you add the cayenne pepper- not everyone appreciates the heat! I made this for the first time, my fiancé loved it. It had good flavor but definitely needed salt, the recipe didn’t call for any extra salt aside from the spices. I added maybe 1/2 tsp and some Louisiana hot sauce and it was super tasty. I also used jasmine rice. Will make this again. My family loves this recipe! I double the amount to feed my husband, 2 teenage boys, 1 daughter, and myself. Never do we have leftovers unfortunately! This recipe is so good. I made this for a Xmas dinner at work followed everything to a T , my crockpot was the only one left full , sorry this was terrible, hope this helps , keep looking . Only modification I made was that I did not rinse the beans after soaking overnight. Just cook them in the soaking water. The second rinse is a waste of time and flavor. These beans are overcooked, mushy and under-seasoned. I would not use this recipe again; there are better, more authentic ones available. Delish, fam loves it While everyone has their own twist. Keep in mind cooking is not just a recipe but a technique and skill. Crisping up a few pieces of smoked bacon then the sausage and using the the fat to sauté the trinity will help. Add in a scored smoked ham hock and cooking for 15-20 minutes will make the flavors more Smokey. Add broth and simmer until the meat falls off the bone. Midway you can add the beans. I made this today. Lots of heat and very good. I found this recipe looking for something to do with a bag of small red beans I found in my pantry. I ended up making a few substitutions since this was not planned, but last minute. I found hot Italian sausage worked okay since I couldn't order andouille to be delivered from my grocery store. I also used brown rice instead of white. I cut the meat amount in half as well just for my preferences. I know mine was not authentic, but found it easy to make and extremely tasty and satisfying. Oh my goodness, how much I enjoy Allrecipes 
Have always loved cooking but helped for therapy..Covid has made me a much better cook! 
Thank you for your recipe, added plantains and cod..reminiscent of a trip to the island of Saint john many years ago
..added so ground sausage I had instead of andouie....my brother's homemade vinegar hot sauce, and I used canned red beans It was good but very spicy. Next time instead of rice I'm going to use riced cauliflower. I also added a can of diced tomatoes, drained, and a Tbs of sugar to tone it down. I've been making this recipe for several years and I love it! I don't like andouille sausage so I use pecan smoked beef sausage and add a little extra cajun seasoning. My friend even asked me for the recipe and now it's on regular rotation at her house. Taste like home. Heavenly This recipe was fantastic! I will add that I (regrettably) followed a commenter's tip and one of them was a HUGE mistake. I used the Better Than Bouillon with the water that someone suggested and I even bought the low sodium. IT WAS A SALT LICK. DO NOT do this. I then used 12 potatoes to try  dull the salt.. it was a disaster. In the future, I will do half UNsalted chicken stock and half water. I will NEVER use that Better than Bouillon again, that has SO much sodium in it. After doctoring it I could tell that it was amazing flavor and I cannot wait to make it with out all the salt and just follow my instincts next time. The recipe was really easy and really brings a lot of flavors like traditional RBR from Louisiana. I variated a tad, I used red beans and pinto beans and it came out really good, I would have loved to add some hot peppers to the recipe but everyone can't take the heat. Great recipe! I always forget to soak beans overnight and found a site that told me to bring the beans to a boil in a pot of water and then remove them from the heat and cover for at least 1 hour, 4 hours ideally. I let mine sit for 4 hours and started the recipe and they turned out great! I cooked the sausage on the side because my husband is a vegetarian, but I bet the recipe would be spectacular with the sausage cooked in it. Also, I probably doubled the creole seasoning because we love flavor and heat, spectacular! Will be making this again! This recipe shouldn't be made with water as the only liquid. Very very bland. I even substituted some of the water with broth (half and half) and it still came out flavorless. I had to do more to save this recipe, in order to not be embarrassed when my husband ate it.. Like add liquid smoke, Tabasco sauce, adobo, regular salt, and more Cajun seasoning. Zatarains won this one. If he would fry the sausage until brown, reduce fat if needed and sauté the veggies in this it would help infuse a better Cajun flavor. Otherwise, Great Job! It tasted really good. I will use this recipe again. You don't need to rinse and soak overnight at all. Simply put them in a pot, cover with 2-3"" cold water, add 1 tblspn baking soda. Bring just u
nder a boil, cover and reduce heat to a medium low heat for 2 hours. Drain and use as if you'd soaked them.
Never add salt ot salted stock to beans until they've cooked until almost done. Salt toughens the beans up. So be careful if you use a commercial Creole or Cajun seasoning since they're prominently salt. Make your own and leave the salt out.
A stalk of celery is the large grouping made up of multiple ribs. Adjust the recipe accordingly and use 2 ribs of celery. 5 star rating for me. I will make this again. Followed the recipe as stated. Delicious.
Wasn’t able to show photo will not download. This smelled wonderful while cooking. The finished product was bland. There was heat from the cayenne, but that was it. Following other suggestions, I used a combination of 3/4 chicken broth to 1/4 water. I also used a pound of andouille sausage  a 1/2 pound turkey sausage. The beans were cooked well  I mashed about 1/3 as recommended. I don’t know what seasoning/spice it needs, but something to add flavor. I’m going to try the leftovers tomorrow  try to add some more seasoning to see if that helps. Very Authentic Louisiana recipe!! I always use Conecuh Sausage because I just love it more than any other type of meat to put in Red beans. Yummee!!! This recipe has no flavor. I was truly excited but all you can taste is heat. The only thing I would add is more salt. It is very bland with just the Cajun seasoning mix (I used Tony Chachere’s). The recipe was great after I added two table spoons of kosher salt, twice the bay leaves and Cajun seasoning, and 1/2 tsp pepper. I also took 2 cups and put it in the blender and re added it to the bean mixture. Otherwise, it was a good template. 
. This was excellent. I used 2 cans of red kidney beans instead of cooking dried beans. I also added the spices to the vegetables that I was cooking in the pan. I added only 1 cup of water to the vegetables, beans and sausage, since I used canned beans. I normally don't offer reviews on recipes, but here I'm making an exception. This recipe is absolutely the best red beans and rice I've ever tasted. Other reviewers suggested adding a ham hock and that is the only thing I changed. We like our beans cooked down quite a bit, so they are thicker. Additionally, we are not big on measuring spices either, but wow, this was really good. Thanks for sharing. I had never made red beans and rice before but my family and I love to eat it, so my husband and I decided to take a crack at making a shrimp boil and red beans and rice last night. I gave it four stars only because I had to add Oregano, as well as increase the other listed spices toward the end. But the result was amazing. It definitely tastes like authentic red beans and rice, although I can see that it's gonna be even better after sitting overnight. I definitely make this more like a new-age vegan acadian, Tex/New Mexican influenced by pan-Asian cuisine. I used Serrano peppers, habanero peppers, bok choy and rainbow chard stems, turmeric and flax (as opposed to file). I keep the Acadian Jasmine Rice and Beans and prep method down to the authentic brands. This is a great recipe. Quite easy to make.
 I changed nothing. This is definitely a keeper Love this recipe! It’s been along time since I’ve made this and being from Cajun country Mississippi Louisiana area this is a must for the cooler weather. I always add a little bit of my flare to include some ham hocks Very taste and spicy and worth making again and again. This is very close to how I make mine, and mine closely follows one of Prudhomme's old recipes. I used to throw in a couple of ham hocks but they're more expensive lately so I cook the beans in stock made from a ham bone that's been soaked and rinsed to cut back on the salt. The Prudhomme recipe that I base this on called for kielbasa and that's what I usually use since it's much cheaper than andouille (this is supposed to be 'peasant' food after all). I use a little more thyme and a little worcestershire. For heat I encourage the use of Louisiana style hot sauce according to each person's taste. It's perfect the way it is. I didn't change a thing. This is a delicious easy to prepare recipe everyone loved it Louisiana born  raised. This is a very authentic recipe imho. Really wanted to give it 5 stars but the 1st step (sautéing the ""trinity"" in olive oil) is just not the way we do it here. You want to slice  brown the andoille sausage  use the drippings as the oil for the trinity (onion, bell pepper  celery) The only other thing I do differently is to use Camellia brand beans  follow the bag instructions for the beans (no soaking). I made this recipe almost entirely as written. It turned out great. The only changes I made was to ad some salt and I added a ham hock to the beans while simmering them. When the simmering time had about 20 minutes left I pulled out the ham hock, shredded and diced all the meat from the hock (including the skin) and threw it back in the beans. Apart from needing some salt, the seasonings were right on target.

It's definitely worth making and I'll make this recipe again and again. Turned out great. My boyfriend loved it, and he’s a picky eater! Louisiana boy who grew up eating red beans and rice. This recipe is the real deal. It’s become a stable in my home and I serve it up twice a month. It’s just me and my daughter, so I cut the portions in half because we only need leftovers for two days instead of four. Absolutely loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently than what the recipe suggested was to use a red bell pepper instead of green. No one in our family likes green peppers! Rich flavor and a full meal when served with the rice. We will absolutely make this again! This dish was very good. I made substitutions because I did not want to venture out to the market for ingredients I did not have. This time, I used chorizo sausage, celery powder, and a green pepper from my garden. I recommend it as is, or with personal adjustments! Used soaked over night pinto beans, used 10 cups low sodium chicken broth instead of water and no celery, used zucchini it’s what I had on hand. Also a jalapeño chopped fine. Didn’t use sage, didn’t have any. Was delicious, and we ate it as soup, no rice. I followed the recipe other than using Italian sausage in lieu of Andouille as it is not easily available where I now live. The heat was much greater than I recall when I ate red beans and rice every Monday night in New Orleans in the late 70s. Tonight's dish is far too hot for children. Perhaps sautéing less cayenne in the beginning would allow taste without extreme heat. Cooking recipes for Indian cuisine always involves frying the spices early rather than tossing them in the liquid. Have been making this recipe for nine years. Last month for the first time used andouille sausage, which kicked this recipe over the top. Also use the homemade Cajun seasoning from this site. Everyone I have served this to loves it. Over the years have become lazy and use 4 cans of red kidney beans. Did not change the taste one bit. Delicious! I didn't have any bell peppers or thyme but it turned out delicious! I reduced the cayenne in half and added 1/2T of salt when I added the sausage. This is going into the rotation at our house! delicious! my family ate it up. Wonderful! I had kidney beans that were already cooked, so I sautéed the veggies about an hour before I planned to serve the dish. Then I added the beans and spices with a bit of liquid. I let that simmer. About 30 minutes before serving, I mashed the beans and added the sausage. So yummy! I served this with Oven Baked Rice from this website. This recipe hit the spot after trying it for the first time! I'm from Houston so I can't say my taste is the same as people rating this 1 star, however I believe this recipe deserves more than that. It came out very tasty. I'm makingit now for the second time but am adding a tad more cayenne and cajun seasoning for more spice. Outstanding! I used a 1/3 of a pork tenderloin I had smoked on my Traeger  1/2 # of andouille sausage. It turned put great! Next time I'll add more cayenne, we like it spicy, along with some more Lousianna hot sauce. I live on the Gulf Coast. I've been making and eating red beans and rice all my life. I have to say this was fast, easy, and as good as it gets! Notes: added worchester sauce, smoked paprika, butter, maple syrup, and nutritional yeast to sub flavor of andouille sausage. My vegetarian recipe uses most of the spices in this red beans and rice recipe, plus these additional ones. Added just enough water to cover beans and kept adding as needed during cooking to produce thick soupy beans. 2.5 hours was just about right to marry the flavors and break down the acidity of the peppers. SO COMFORTING AND YUM! Loved this recipe. I used canned black beans and used chicken stock instead of the water. So so good. This was a great recipe! I enjoyed making it. I added Cajun shrimp on top and cornbread on the side. Great Southern Comfort meal. very good! enjoyed it! I've made this recipe several times and I've used canned red beans for a shortcut on time. I've used my instapot to cut down on time. Fantastic! Don't hesitate! It is delicious!! Not what I ate in Metrearie,La., when I was a kid. Do not use cajun spice! If you like spicy, have some Tobasco sauce on the side to add if needed. We are not southerners, so can't speak to the authenticity, but it was fun to make and delicious! We made this as part of a southern themed family night, along with corn bread and a southern cucumber and tomato salad recipe I found. We'll definitely make this again! ",1,20.166666666666668

Added some lemon zest to the batter because typically I like lemon with blueberries. Very yummy and easy recipe. I think I made these before, and they were good. But I made some adjustments that helped! Doubled the recipe Used one spoonful of sour cream in place of milk Added a splash of vanilla Added a small pinch of salt to topping Used brown sugar for topping (only used about half) Filled 12 muffins to top Started at 425° for 5-10 minutes down to 400° for another 10 minutes or more as needed (My oven was running low ~25°) I have made these more than a dozen times and every single time they disappear in 1 day. They are my family’s favorite! Just made these and they are absolutely the best blueberry muffins ever! I used fresh blueberries 🥰 Great, worked fantastically, with a couple edits. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup for both muffin and topping. I also mixed 1 ripe banana into the batter. They amounts for the topping far exceeded how much I needed for my muffins, maybe my tray is small, but I could've made due with 1/4 flour for sure. Still, they were quite delicious, not sure why some people had trouble with the topping sinking into the batter, no issues here. I think this is the best blueberry muffin I have ever made. Moist and so delicious. One of my favorite recipes. It's not to sweet, perfect for the mornings. Easy and fast to make and the crumble on top makes this muffin so tasty Family loved the muffins!! Best I have ever made. Going to try using raspberries instead of blueberries. Will use this recipe always. I am not a fan of blueberry muffins. Tried a different recipe before this. Family liked them. Decided to try this one. HUGE hit and I love them. Use a little more milk, aside from that awesome recipe. Absolutely delicious! Love how Fluffy and tender the muffin is. The streusel topping takes it to the next level. These are my favorite easy to go muffins to make, they are so delicious and a fan favorite at bake sales. Please, do not fill the muffin cups to the top like the recipe says! I did that questioning it as I did it, but, did it anyways and now everything overfilled out of the cups and the streusel sunk to the center. This is by far the worst recipe for muffins I’ve ever made. I’ve been baking for many, many years and never had this result. I reread the recipe to make sure I didn’t do something wrong and I did exactly what the recipe called for. I’m very disappointed. With the cost of food being so expensive this was really upsetting. I will not make these again. Not to mention the flavor was bland, extremely bland. I tried one just to see if it even tasted edible, and it’s just overload of sugar. The blueberry flavor is even lost in all of that sugar, way too much topping! Moist muffins, topping sets it off. LOVE this recipe!!The only chang e I made was using light brown sugar instead of white sugar for the crumb topping. For a first time Blueberry Muffin maker this recipe is so easy and they are delicious and my family really enjoyed them. I will be making them again. The recipe was great but I would add extra flour or milk if needed or desired. This is the worst recipe ever. I made this recipe twice thinking I did something wrong the first time and the second time was even worse. What a waste of good ingredients…twice I added a dash of vanilla and a tablespoon of sour cream - delicious! I made these with plain kefir and a bit of milk instead of just milk. They were the best blueberry muffins I've had, the whole family loves them! I used King Arthur gluten free flour 1:1 and didn’t change one other thing. They were perfect. Also made a batch with all purpose flour and we preferred gluten free option. My son could not believe I made these ! This recipe just replaced my old recipe, its so good! Perfect. No changes. Hands down the best muffin recipe! My daughter and I made 2 batches, one blueberry and the other we swapped milk chocolate chips and the topping I swapped light brown sugar for the white. The brown sugar topping was like a cookie… eat warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert… so good!! Woke up early to make this with my morning coffee Followed recipe exactly. Made 6 large muffins. Tasty basic muffin. I used frozen blueberries and needed 30min to cook. Butter for topping needs to be soft, it wouldn't crumble for me. Not sure if I like the topping or not..kind of prefer non cinnamon type (unless using apples rather than blueberries) all in all good basic small batch muffin recipe that could accommodate different fillings . Great recipe and tasty muffins. Based on the ‘to die for’ title, I was really hoping for more than mediocre muffins. Nothing special about these honestly. The directions say fill to top then add the strudel. I filled mine 3/4’s of the way and then topped with strudel. The Muffins didn’t rise very much, but even filling them 3/4’s of the way, left me using a butter knife to circle every muffin cup to get the muffin/strudel loose from the pan so that could actually be removed from the pan. Depending on the toppings of your strudel mix, that is the flavoring of the muffin. The muffins themselves don’t offer a lot of flavor, but they are moist. These are fantastic! The crumb topping is amazing! This is my favorite BB muffin recipe. I thought it used to have an option to change the ingredients from 8 muffins to 6. Anyway, I make this as written but decrease recipe to 6 muffins. Works out great. Only change - because I don’t like the crumb topping on recipes, I just add a little sugar cinnamon mixture. Love’em. Solid Recipe. Do not add extra sugar and I would half salt. I wish I thought to add lemon flavoring. I made 9 medium sized muffins. Add 3tblsp water to empty muffin slots. I used left over streusel toppings from a boxed brand. Perfect My kids loved these muffins! The streusal topping turned out great and kinda crunchy. Instead of all sugar for the topping, I just have to turbinado sugar and half white. loving this recipe! about to make them again because they didn't last more than an hour. they are light and fluffy yet very creamy. I used organic cane sugar, frozen haskap berries and powdered whole milk because it'd run out. I skipped the topping and happy I did so. This recipe did not rise and the strudel on top pooled in the center making the middle of the muffin gooey. The flavor of the muffin was bland and the strudel top helped give it some sweetness. Very disappointed. First time every making a muffin from scratch I didn't do very good job but they taste amazing despite my mess Delicious, moist blueberry muffins. Will be my go to muffin recipe from now on. This is the best recipe ever! Everyone that I share it with is obsessed with it!! I’m sure it’s perfect as is, but I use brown sugar for the crumble. That’s the only thing I change… only because I love brown sugar lol thank you for this perfect recipe Sorry but they came out like bricks and tasted like raw flour. I followed the recipe and I also double checked afterwards to make sure I got it right and every thing was correct. Don't know why they were gross. I've made these a few times and love them. I was wondering if I could put this into a 9x13 pan? Delicious! So easy to make and the crumble was perfect. It was a little messy getting out of the tins but it is the best blueberry muffin I’ve ever made. I used fresh blueberries and added a little more than a cup. Made 8, followed the recipe/video to a T. Wouldn’t change anything. Delicious!!! Love the crunchy crumble top. I made it exactly as instructed and they turned out perfectly. I did have a lot of extra crumble, so I might cut it back by 25% next time. Also, my batch yielded 10 large muffins. For anyone who had issues maybe over mixing was the problem? They don’t rise much so do fill the batter to the top. Happy baking! Excellent recipe! Turned out perfect. Thank you. Love these muffins, and so easy to make. Fresh blueberries definitely work best and I put them in the bottom of the case, add some batter then add more blueberries and then batter, followed by a brown sugar topping, which gives them a bit of a crunch .. my friends don’t like them if I don’t add the brown sugar. I added extra blueberries 😋. Just because we love them. What a quick, convenient recipe. I had everything on hand. I wish I could describe how good the house smells from them baking 😁 We've made a few batches, first one was following recipe to a ""T"". That batch was a little dry. We've continued to work the recipe and the other night made another batch. We added extra milk (almost doubled what recipe says), upped Blueberries to 1 - 3/4 cups, added teaspoon of vanilla and zest from half lemon. We made 6 jumbo muffins. Baked for 28 minutes - these were the best yet so we'll probably stick with this version. For the topping, I only used half from the batch we made a couple weeks ago so I saved the leftover. I added some extra butter and chopped pecans. Also sprinkled with turbo sugar. These muffins look and feel like a bakery style muffin. They are beautiful and look great. I doubled the recipe and my only comment is that there was way too much crumble. I stuck with it but next time would use less. The muffins rose beautifully and the topping did not sink at all. I always use a glove, and blend the topping manually. I need a bit more flavor in the muffin. I'll add vanilla, or maple syrup next time. Good luck getting 5 muffinds out of this. There’s way too much crumble glaze and not enough muffin. This is a great recipe! really easy and delicious recipe! not a lot of space to mess up if you follow the instructions, however the top review (chef joy) has a super great topping alternative as the one in the recipe is not ideal. if the actual recipe included that topping recipe it would be 5 stars. i've made this for my friends and some of them have been begging me to bake them more, it works with frozen but fresh are always better. I used a 6 muffin tin and made half the crumble. Giant, beautiful and TO DIE FOR… I make these all of the time! I put them in the monster cupcake tins and it is an entire meal! Followed recipe. Batter was thick, but it was beneficial. I did not get the topping to crumb, it turned out more like a paste, which I still used. I think the thick batter prevented the muffin from sinking in the middle with the heavier topping. I did not fill right to the top, but the shape was fine. Served for brunch, and my guests really enjoyed them. These are great...I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand, the milk was actually heavy cream and water. The oil was extra virgin olive oil. They were not done at 20 minutes and at 25 minutes toothpick came out clean. Perfect crumb to the body and the topping was great. the recipe said to fill the paper cups, and I have muffins pouring out of the pan.... DO NOT FILL to the top! I followed the directions exactly as they were given and only added a tsp of vanilla. The batter looked very thick but I stuck with it and baked them. They came out pretty dry and a little crumbly but they still taste good! Might add a little more milk or oil than originally suggested due to how dry. Loved the crumbly top! By far the best blueberry muffins I've ever made. Easy recipe and they came out perfect. Hubby and I devoured them. I didn't have a problem with them sticking like some comments I read, I simply used muffins liners. I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar in the crumble. Make them, you won't regret it! Fine and EASY blueberry muffin recipe. I used a 6 jumbo pan (they were about 2/3 full) and substituted buttermilk. Delicate crumb. Melted the butter in topping and crumbled w fork. The vegetable oil in batter is easy but gives it one less star. I have a love/hate with this recipe. I think the taste is absolutely DELICIOUS! I hate that whether I use paper cupcake holders or not, they run together. Today I didn't use paper cups and used crisco inside and around the top of the tin pan (an old Muffinaire) and they all STUCK! So if you don't mind fighting with it, give it a try. Maybe it's just me ;) These tasted great! The crumbles were good too! I might have filled the muffin cups too high because the crumbles started to fall off, but flavor is what counts! 👍😁 You Just Can't Mess this up! Decadent! If your batter is too thick, I suggest adding milk to get the desired consistency. Better than store brands. I made these gluten-free using Bobs Red Mill 1:1 GF flour and these came out phenomenal! Even my picky husband loved them and wont stop eating them lol. Hands down the absolute best blueberry muffins I’ve ever had seriously. I made these today they are really good.Will make them again I made it at altitude (7,600 feet) without modification, except I used frozen blueberries. The bake time was too short, but before the toothpick came out clean, the edges were darker than I would have liked. Perhaps 400 is a little too high in our oven. The batter was very thick and hard to manage, but it filled 8 standard size muffin cups almost exactly to the top. I used foil muffin cups and they came out fine, even though I didn't grease the top of the pan. I had way too much crumb topping and had to throw quite a bit away. The recipe is a keeper in our family. Easy and quick. I had never made muffins before (from scratch) and these were easy and very tasty! I didn't bother with the topping. Based on the comments, and I just didn't feel it needed it. Easy recipe and good flavor. The topping is so delicious but if you make 8 muffins the topping runs off the top all over the pan. It has way too much butter so it isn't crumbly. I would suggest using way less butter and also making them a little smaller so it won't run off. Prepping these ""To Die For Blueberrrie Muffins"" for my fellow Coach Hammie. He consumes many carbs B4 his workout routine. So, he asked if I could bake these for him. Well, his wish is my command. Easy to prep recipe!! I would add 2 T of water to tin cups not filled. The water evaporated completely. I would also cut the crumble recipe in half due to the fact that only 8 big muffins were made. I’ve made some tweaks and these are the best muffins ever. Melt the butter, otherwise you have too much flour. Add a teaspoon of vanilla to the muffin batter. Add a pinch of salt to the crumble too. You can also add a little nutmeg to the crumble mixture. It was great, except the bottom got hard. The butter from crumb topping may have dropped down. What can I do different? They are good My husband and I both love this recipe. I did add vanilla and cut back on the sugar though, I will definitely make these again. I didn't care for these. I thought the batter was very bland They are my favorite! Followed the recipe but used 6 muffin pan. They came out perfect. The crumbs came out crunchy. Made 2 batches and they disappear. Definitely will make again and again. I’ll try using chocolate chips next. Yum!! I followed the advice of others and split the sugars half white half brown, and i even mushed up some extra blueberries and mixed that into the batter. They aren't even out of the oven yet and I'm already so in love with them! I made mine dairy free by swapping out dairy milk for oat milk for the muffins, and by using vegetable oil instead of butter for the crumble (I had a lot of unused crumble mix leftover, so maybe halve the recommended amount unless you plan to save it for another recipe). The only other tweak I made was using half white sugar and half brown sugar, instead of all white sugar for the amount listed (I did this for both the muffins and the crumble). These turned out fluffy, moist, and delicious. I’ll definitely make them again. Also, thanks for the tip about using a splash of water in the empty/unused muffin cups so the muffins don’t burn - I think that helped a lot! Got mixed up with another recipe that required the baking soda and salt be dissolved in hot water? I don't even know if it was a Blueberry muffin recipe, I can't find it. 🙃 The kitchen has 3 desserts going on this weekend and I'm an old lady😂 I doubled the recipe as suggested. The crumb was far too much for 16 muffins. 🤨 I have 3 cups left that I'll use in an apple crumble. 😋 So I somehow combined two recipes. First time using a phone instead of printing things out.🤳 Turned out fine  tasty despite my weird errors. Fluffy  light. 🫐 A little too crumbly (and crumby) but worthy of a bake sale or a fast breakfast. I'll update if I make the recipe as written. I'll also post the crumble if i remember😁 These were fantastic! I was able to make 6 chocolate chip and 6 blueberry with the standard recipe. They came out PERFECT! I did not have to tweak the recipe, except when separating the batter to make a chocolate chip batter. They were moist, tasty, and the whole family loved them. I put the frozen blueberries in the dry mixture before adding the wets. I use parchment paper instead of paper cups, and I use a 6 muffin jumbo pan, which delivers moist, large, well-risen muffins. This is my go to recipe and it’s quite simple. I first downloaded this recipe back in 2012 and it is still my FAVORITE muffin recipe to make! Very easy, and sooooooo good! BTW, I always make 12 muffins with this recipe and they are still very generous in size. Also, I pat the topping down gently after adding so it stays on the muffin without falling off when they come out of the oven. Enjoy! Omg so good.. Really easy and very delicious, I added just a pinch more milk to the muffin and some brown sugar to the crumble which made them a little bit more moist and sweet. The muffins were good. The only thing I would suggest is adding the crumb mixture time you take them out of the oven. When you add it before you bake it doesn't leave the crumb texture. They look fabulous. Just came out of the oven so I haven't tasted them yet. . . What I want to tell you is that there is more batter than what you think. One recipe completely filled all 12 spots on my cupcake pan. It almost overflowed! Then I added the topping and it was mounded quite a bit. . . My pan is the generic size. . . Look forward to having one with a cup of coffee! Delicious! If you love the Dunkin ones these are 10x better!! Super moist! I made jumbo muffins with a brown coffee filter for the paperwrap- doubled the recipe and made 8 total. (also added 3 tsp of Vanilla Extract) I have made this recipe countless times and it is always a huge hit for all those that partake. The muffin it's self is beautiful light, fluffy and so moist. I have use both fresh and frozen blueberries and I do not know that I could choose better two ways they are both equally delightful. Some say add vanilla, it is not needed and if two batches were made, one with and one without I'm not sure anyone could tell the difference. So if you feel compelled to add it go ahead it makes no difference. I also use butter in place of the oil once, that I do not recommend. As you can guess it significantly changes the texture of the muffin it is much better with the oil. The topping is a pleasant crunch but you could leave it off if you like and they are still delicious. My husband may say otherwise bc he absolutely love these muffins with out changes to the authors direction. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with us! Recipe was fantastic. You can definitely cut the topping in half as I didn’t use it all. My dad’s new favorite blueberry muffins! I wasn't impressed with this recipe. they tasted more like a bran muffin, I couldn't really taste the blueberries. I have a favorite box mix that I add fresh blueberries to that is much better. Frustrating at best. I knew when the recipe said to fill to the top the topping would overhang and make the muffins hard to remove and I knew it was suspect when the recipe said to fill an in-exact amount of milk to the top of the measuring cup that this was a bad idea. Wasted time, ingredients and a mess in my kitchen…would not recommend. No taste other than the streusel topping and ugly, disintegrated muffins plus the batter was too thick to easily fold in blueberries because of the inaccurate methods of measuring liquid ingredients These are really good. I didn’t use the topping, just put coarse sugar on top and added a little lemon juice. I made 12 because I had leftover batter. They were great. A big hit with everyone. Was told they were the best muffins people had 3ver tried! These muffins are absolutely delicious!!! I doubled the recipe and it made exactly 18 regular sized muffins. However, I doubled the crumble and it made way too much. I probably could have gotten away with just doubling the batter and not the crumble and had plenty! Ugly little things but tasty! I measured the blueberries to start but threw in quite a few more, I doubled the recipe so I doubled the crumble topping and I had way more topping than I needed, probably could’ve just doubled the batch without doubling the crumble topping. Great muffins! I made no changes and they came out beautifully. Family favorite!!! So good! Our family eats gluten and dairy free (allergies) and I took a chance on this recipe even though it is not written for GF/DF. It turned out perfect! I used the exact measurements of the original recipe but substituted a mixture of Namaste GF flour and Tapioca Starch. I used Avocado oil as the oil, Flax milk instead of cow’s and Earth Balance instead of butter. These blueberry muffins are soft, HUGE, full of flavor and so good. Thank you for the base recipe! These Blueberry Muffins were the best ever, I would compare them to Dunkin doughnuts but are better because they are loaded with lots of fresh blueberries. I don’t bake a lot because I just end up eating at all! Lol. I also need to watch my blood sugar. This is a very simple recipe and easy to follow. I always appreciate the accompanying videos to recipes; my batter was quite thick, so added extra milk to have it look more like the batter in the video. I did add some vanilla but because I need to watch my blood sugar, I substituted Truvia for the sugar in both the batter and topping. I would definitely make this recipe again and recommend trying it. I made them as mini muffins and cooked them for about 8-10 min. It made 36 muffins that were moist and flavorful! Definitely making these again! Okay. Trust me. I’m not a paid actor. This was THE BEST MUFFIN RECIPE IVE TRIED! The milk thing was confusing. I ended up adding a splash more since the batter was too thick. So moist, and the crunch topping is ESSENTIAL. It adds the perfect amount of crunch to the muffin. I used fresh Michigan blueberries too. Definitely making this again. My family ate them all in one night!!! Ps. Ditch the fork for the topping and get in there with your hands! ;) ",1,21.666666666666668

I added walnuts  chocolate chips!!..... 🤙 Simple and yet full of flavor. I used old organic discount bananas and I am extremely happy with the results. Not to much sugar and simple. All the banana flavor I wanted. I also love that there is no vanilla in her. easy and delicious! This is an easy and delicious recipe, but beware that it's not sweet as it is. Here's a tip if you like your banana bread tasting sweet: -Put one cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup. If you don't have enough brown sugar, you can use whatever brown sugar you have left and substitute the rest with regular sugar. Additional Tips: - Make sure to poke the center of the bread a few times once the bread starts forming. This is so you don't have a doughy center. -You'll need 7-8 bananas for this recipe. It doesn't make a difference if you put 8 instead of 7 so use what you have. -It doesn't matter if you Light or Dark brown sugar. Mini Loaf Tip: 1. If you're baking mini loafs (6.29 ""W 1.77""H), I suggest baking them for only 25 minutes. I've made this bread several times already, and everyone loves them! Easy to make! I added nuts and a little cinnamon, and it was wonderful. My household loved this banana bread recipe! I replaced sugar with Truvia's brown sugar blend, it was super delicious. i’ve been making this banana bread since my kids were born 24 years ago at least it feels that long. best and easy in just an hour Made 4 minis, added white chocolate chips and pecan pieces. Loaves baked for 36 min. Best recipe ever for nanner bread!! By far our favorite. I make these regularly with my 11 yr old son. Been a favorite for 3 yrs now. Quick and easy. Added vanilla  cinnamon. Absolutely best I've tried! Was a big hit with family, even those not banana lovers! I made two loads and my son ate them in a week. He wants more. He usually won’t eat breakfast but now he has a couple slices of banana bread. Smells AMAZING!!! Just came out of the oven and can't wait to taste it!! Looks perfect. I add 2 extra bananas and a tbs of Vanilla to the recipe. Comes out great every time!!! All round great recipe for banana bread. I added walnuts and chocolate chips and it was yummy. Baked in a glass pan so it actually took 20 min. less to get done. Great recipe! Everyone loved it. Taste even better the next day. Absolutely delicious I replaced the baking soda with baking powder and the butter with vegetable oil because that's what I had. Will definitely make again Terrific banana bread! I had some bananas to use up and all the rest of the ingredients and threw this together real quick this morning. Nicely dense and moist! Would make again! Simple recipe. Is a nice heavy and moist bread. My daughter called it the best ever. Takes 7 medium bananas so plan ahead to have plenty of very ripe bananas on hand. The best Banana Bread ever! I do use only 1/2 cup of the brown sugar, or regular sugar, if I have no brown sugar. It is still sweet and delicious. In my opinion, the wonderful flavors come out better the next day or two. Am making it tonight, adding some Walnuts :) Great recipe that completely lives up to its billing!! Fantastic! Great recipe. I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and some chocolate chips. This was so good! I added 1/3 cup of greek yogurt to make it more moist and did 1 whole cup of brown sugar. Husband and toddler approved. Love this recipe. I make it more health focused by using almond flour for half of the flour and adding 1/2c of ground Flax. I also add 1/2 T of Cinnamon and 1 t of All spice, as well as 1 t of vanilla. The best BB I have made! It is so easy and rich in flavor. This is the only banana bread recipe you need! I only add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and it is a no fail recipe! Been making this for over 10 years since this recipe has been on this site. You won’t be disappointed 😊 My family love to recipe eats it all in a day Very good taste. My husband raved about this bread. I will make it again. short on bananas . had to wing it with ingredient amounts. the recipe is simple and look forward to adding other ingredients. Used this recipe for 5 years always great, I do add 4 medium bananas with comes out closer to 3cups and I do add walnuts. Delicious and easy! My birthday boy is making short work of it! This seems to be the lightest and ariest banana bread I've had. All I had were two good-sized bananas left. So I used both of them in it. This is my new banana bread recipe! Thanks! Turned out perfect! Moist, just the right amount of sweet. Kids loved it too never having banana bread before. Great recipe. I make banana bread often. This recipe is easy and the bread is delicious. I add mini chocolate chips. I only use whatever over-ripe bananas I have on hand 3-4. Delicious! Turned out great :) If you’re looking for a sweet, dessert type bread - avoid this recipe. This is a very well made bread. None of the ingredients are overpowering. Actually, other than the bananas, you won’t taste anything. Not a pinch of salt, butter, or sugar. A little on the bland side, but I think that’s the intention, and the recipe produces a well made bread. This is the recipe for you if you’re a banana bread purist. I like fruit breads to be on the sweeter side. I’ve made this 6/7 times now. The first, I followed the recipe exactly. After that, I always make sure to double the salt, add white sugar, and 2 more tablespoons of butter. I also add in some well mashed pineapple and mandarin oranges. I know that it’s not the same recipe, but I’ve made the original. It’s a great base for me to make something sweeter and to my liking. Again, great basic banana bread. This was delicious. I decreased the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and used 4 bananas, and it was still plenty sweet. I baked it in my Cuisinart combination air fryer at 325degrees. It took close to an hour. Been making this for years it is the best ! The banana banana bread recipe is moist and tastes amazing ! My tweet to this recipe was 5 bananas 2tbsp of vanilla ,1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar. I Place batter in pan,sprinkled turbinado sugar on top of batter and placed a few pecans on top then baked it . Awesome recipe, it has the right amount of flavour. Not too dry or underbaked either! Definitely going to be using this recipe again. 10/10, I recommend this recipe! 5 Stars for Easy. Waiting for the finished product now... Raising high so may have to cook it longer than 60 min.... I made it but had to put it in longer because it came out loose from bananas on inside so throw it back in for another 15 minutes. But tasty nice I have made this COUNTLESS times. The literal only thing I do differently is throw in some pecans and mini chocolate chips. This is the absolute best banana bread. Ever. This is the best banana bread! I've been using this exact recipe broken down to mini loaves (with a cup of dark chocolate chips) for over 10 years! It's moist and delicious. I even make edibles with it. Anyone that rates this a 1 clearly made a mistake when making the recipe. Thank you for posting this! Great recipe, I. added one teaspoon of vanilla extract and some walnuts for added flavor. Thanks My husband and I live in Guatemala, where bananas are plentiful and inexpensive. We love this bread, and make it frequently. Because of diabetes, I also cut the amount of sugar to half and add in wheat germ and or ground flax. I also normally spray my pans with Pam or similar, then sprinkle sesame or poppy seeds inside and on top for a crunchy extra touch. It’s my go-to banana bread. Amazing flavor and super moist! This is banana bread as good as it gets! Sweet with a lovely banana taste. I love this recipe. I added about 1 TBSP of banana extract, 1 tsp of vanilla and some chocolate chips. It was delicious Very good recipe. I tweaked it just a bit. I added 1 shot of banana liquor, some chocolate chips, and 8 shots of rum.(1 shot in the batter, 7 shots in my mouth) Banana bread perfection!! The ONLY change I made was I added cinnamon and white sugar to the top before baking bc I like a crispy top. It was wonderful!! I never baked a banana bread before, hoped this recipe will work... and I am happy to report that I nailed it first time! And it is truly delicious! It is now a saved favorite for me! I added my own twist with some cinnamon and nutmeg, after I mixed that in I added a bit of cat hair for the in-laws, 10/10 recommend!! They loved it :) It was yummy I love this recipe. I like the extra egg and cinnamon being an option (not a fan of lots of cinnamon in recipes) I do add some but almost trace amounts with about the same amounts of nutmeg, cumin and a pinch of paprika. (I do that with all my oatmeal like cookies and banana bread) something about such a tiny bit of each makes it it’s own great flavor, which I enjoy! To each their own though! -But this recipe is a great starter or as is recipe, which is my kind of recipe! Absolutely delicious banana banana bread, except I made cup cakes and added cinnamon toast crunch frosting. I didnt mash the bananas enough lol but the taste is great! used 4 bananas, less sugar (i used old coconut sugar in place of brown). I will likely add sultanas next time :) Great recipe I loved this recipe. My question is can I triple the recipe as is or do I need to make adjustments. Thanks The bread turned out very moist as described. I added walnuts and a teaspoon of vanilla. I would have liked it a little sweeter but overall this was very good and I will continue to use this with some tweaks to make sweeter. Made it exactly as recommended. Baking time 1 hour. Extra banana-e for sure. Family loved it and whip it up every time I have enough over ripe bananas. Utter garbage. Way too much flour. Easy, just needed to add, about a half a cup of half and half, to make it more moist. I've been using this recipe for years and it is always a hit! Best banana bread I've ever had ! Love it toasted! Only bananna bread recipe I have used for years!! So moist and actually tastes like banannas! I have added walnuts, mixed nuts, raisins, chocolate chips, trail mix, etc. (not all at same time) and the loaves are amazing!! easy to follow instructions and delicious results Turned out a little bland needs more flavor but it was nice and moist! I made a vegan, gluten-free version by using vegan butter, egg replacement and gluten-free flour. Delicious! Very easy to make in a pinch. Added chocolate chips, cause, why not? It was nice and I enjoyed it 😊 Very nice so moist I was disappointed. I used 5 very ripe bananas, which should have been enough to give a good banana flavor. The bread was very moist, but it didn’t have a great flavor. It really needed vanilla to perk it up a notch. I’ll keep using my recipe I’ve used for more than 30 years. Stuck to the recipe with no substitutions. Came out very dry and dense. Didn’t have much flavor either. Will stick to my original recipe. This is my go-to banana bread and it's fantastic. Sometimes I add walnuts and sometimes I add some ground flax or even chia seeds. You can't taste them and they're both very healthy--I love how you can easily fold little extras into this recipe like that. I like to double this recipe and freeze a loaf to give away to neighbors or friends when it's appropriate. This last time making this, I was a little shy on bananas, so I added some pineapple tidbits to make up for the missing banana and it was fabulous! Love how easy this is to make or adapt. Very moist. It has a super taste. I even got congrats from a chef !! I recommend it a lot ! Made and shared it with some friends during a movie night and it was gone so quickly! I have a standard banana bread recipe that I normally use but wanted to try a new one. This recipe is delicious and will become my go-to from here on out. I added walnuts and cinnamon. I accidentally mixed the brown sugar with the flour and thought the recipe was ruined but it was amazing! Very fresh banana flavor, very moist and not overly sweet. Definitely give this one a try! Our new favorite! We’ve made it three times and plan to make it every week! We love it! So easy my 5 year old makes it himself now! I am 65 and have tried MANY banana bread recipes over the years. This is, by far, the absolute best. I added one teaspoon of baking powder as others had suggested, and half a teaspoon of cinnamon and crushed walnuts. It was perfect. Thank you for posting~ Perfect recipe as is! So delicious! My first attempt at making Banana Bread. I added some cinnamon chips. Turned out GREAT! Love this recipe, make it for my kids and grandkids❣️Thank you Great recipe! Have tried many this is the best one. Results are always consistent and it's delicious. My go to banana bread recipe! Like several others, added 1 tsp cinnamon, ginger, allspice, baking powder for punched up flavor and a less dense bread. Also, mixing dry ingredients INTO wet, without overmixing, is super important! 1/2 cup of nuts and chocolate chips = banana cake! #sorrynotsorry My favorite  honestly only banana bread I make. Use about 5 bananas and add pecans  dark chocolate chips! Other than that I stick to the recipe! All my friends and family just LOVE it (: I did a comparison between two recipes, two different webpages. Both were good, but this recipe has more banana flavor; therefore, this is my winner. It's my go-to banana bread recipe, and I have tried many other recipes. I make muffins instead of a loaf. I Ieave them in the oven for 18-20 min. I also add about a tsp of cinnamon. This banana bread was the worst I have ever made. I will stick to my original recipe. I made this with additions as suggested by other users: 1 tsp each baking soda  cinnamon, and about 3/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg. I also added 1 cup chopped toasted pecans. This made one generous 9 x 5 loaf, and took 55 minutes in my oven (next time I will check it at 50, as the bottom was on its way to being too dark). I have made a zillion batches (give or take) of banana bread over the years, and this recipe goes right to the top of the list - will be my go-to from here out. Thanks!!! This was a very simple and quick recipe to make. I only added one teaspoon of vanilla extract just because I like the flavor of vanilla. It has a firm crust with a moist middle. My family enjoyed it and I would definitely make it again, This is my”go to” banana bread recipe. Every time I make it, it is delicious!!! Absolutely delicious!! Compliments such as best banana bread coworkers had ever had! Delicious! I didn’t have the 2 1/3 banana - so I added a bit of apple sauce to make up the difference - so so good!! Very good recipe! I added half tsp of allspice and 1 tsp of vanilla to give it that island vibe. Baked it in 2 8X4"" Pyrex loaf pans so I adjusted the time to about 45 mins. Using brown sugar and creaming it with the butter yields a more intense flavor and cake-like texture when compared with other recipes that call for oil and granulated sugar. Definitely a favorite! Easy moist delicious thank you I Loved this recipe!!! I accidently baked this bread inside a pan that was stacked inside another pan, but it came out great!!! Very good recipe. Best banana flavor. Moist and easy to make. Definitely my go to banana bread recipe from now on. ",1,34.333333333333336

I made them the night before and put them in the fridge prior to rising/baking. I took them out of the fridge the next morning and let rise for an hour and a half. My house is cooler but they didn’t rise a lot. They taste great and got rave reviews but they weren’t “fluffy”. I’d say they were a little tough. My dough was tough and difficult to stretch/roll out to the right dimensions. Anybody have a tip to make them lighter/fluffier? It is so light and fluffy. So tasty. It was my first time making it. I need to pratrice on rolling the dough tightly yup. But this recipe so easy, I made it with ought a bread machine. Turned out so good. Came out so yummy 😋. Will definitely be using this recipe again, the only thing I did differently was use regular flour but the texture was still great. I make these ahead and refrigerate them overnight - just put in fridge once ready for second rise. Incredibly good, best cinnamon rolls ever. I added 4 tsp vital wheat gluten to make them fluffier. We LOVED these and think they taste just like Cinnabon! I used all purpose flour and they still turned out great. I am ready to make another batch! I've been making these every year for Christmas, for the past ...6 years I think? Maybe more. I make them exactly as instructed and they are pretty much fool proof. My kids actually like these better than Cinnabon, and that's saying a lot!! I made it as described but reduced the temp to 375 with my glass cake pan. Tastes exactly like Cinnabon…but better! I think the warm cream may be the difference. I will be saving this to use again. Family loved these. Best cinnamon rolls ever and easy to make. I did adjust bake time and temperature to 15 min at 350* and egg washed tops of rolls before baking. Perfection! This is a fantastic recipe! I make it each year for our Christmas breakfast and it's loved by the entire family. I packed them too tight so they came out kinda of wonky, but they still tasted amazing. Even 3 days later on the counter. This is Sooooo addicting!!! I adjusted the recipe by adding a Lil more milk and butter but it came out very delicious and good for my first try. I cut them too thick so I had to make 6 instead of 12,they're huge!!!. We really like these, though I need to adjust baking time for high altitude. Center buns are still raw after 15 minutes at 5,500 ft. Going to try 18ish minutes covered in aluminum foil, then five minutes uncovered for browning. These are amazing! I usually don't have cream cheese or bread flour on hand so skip the former and use all purpose for the latter. These were spectacular. I poured heavy cream on them before baking and they were amazing! I followed the recipe and they came out superb. This was about the fifth ""Cinnabon"" like recipe I've tried. Finally hit the jackpot. These were absolutely wonderful. No bread machine . .. had to go buy some margarine . . and I only use instant yeast, so I used the same amount and mixed it with some of the flour. I mixed the sugar with all the wet . . then added the flour/yeast/salt. Kneaded it with my Kitchenaid for five minutes after I kneaded it by hand a bit. This was the softest, most pliable dough ever. Thank you, Martha, for your posting this . . finally found the soft bread texture I have been searching for! I don't know if the margarine made a difference or not, but the recipe worked well for me, and I have plenty of margarine left, so it will be a while before I try it with butter! I am an experienced baker,and these did not work for me. Heavy dough, and much much too sweet. Will not make again as we threw some away I try to make this clone of a Cinnabon roll twice and my husband loves it and he keeps asking me to make it every Sunday, The rose more than most cinnamon roll recipes and the frosting is very nice. I can chew these okay, I just got my wisdom teeth removed and I had success eating these. We loved the recipe. Definitely will have to ""practice"" to get all the ""bons"" the same size. My family looking forward to further taste testing... I will be sure to make these again. Yummy!! Just what I was hoping for! YUUUMM! When making! Make sure the yeast blooms and you let it rise in a draft free area to dbl the size then roll out and let it rise again in the pan before cooking. Won't need to buy at the store ever again Heavenly!!! Absolutely a family favorite!! Fantastic and so easy with my 30-year old bread machine! I made a confectioners' sugar glaze that may have been on the thin side, but I think that it helped them stay moist for days. On day 3, I popped one in the microwave for 30 seconds on 30 Power and as good as day1! I made these for playing cards with the ladies. OMG!!! Everyone loved them. Said they were better than Cinnabon! Thanks for the great recipe. I made them exactly like the recipe. My first time making cinnamon rolls and these are absolutely amazing. Definitely the best pregnancy craving ever! It was perfect 🥰 💞 I worked at Cinnabon in Seattle WA 1989 I just used my Kitchenaid mixer.... I don't have bread machine everyone loved it I Doubled recipe it made 27 Lg Rolls 😋 now im a star ✨️ at my Husband's work... These were ok. I cooked mine at 350 for 20 minutes. I did extra frosting. Otherwise I made it exactly like they recipe called for. A little dry for me. I like mine gooier. I love this recipe. It's very versatile. I add a few secret ingredients to my recipe just to put my little stamp on it. Just amazing! My family loved these so much! The only thing I did different is used 2tbs of vanilla extract to my drizzle. Other than that I kept it the same! Nobody wants store bought one now. The recipe said it yields 12 rolls I got by with 16. These taste just like cinnabon! we used homemade butter and it gave it a nice touch!!! very good!! Save yourself a lot of trouble and get a ball of pizza dough from your local store or pizza place and then use it to make these. Turns out great; love this recipe our go to for brunch. Constantly requested to make these! Love using the bread maker to proof the dough. Rolling it out is a workout (good for the baker!!) These are a good clone of Cinnabon. I used all purpose flour and just increased the amount a little (1/4 cup more). I also used regular butter and they came out great. This recipe is so delicious, a real winner! It really is so easy to make. I add a bit more cinnamon but otherwise, I follow the recipe. I make a cream cheese icing instead if a drizzle. This has become everyone's favorite. Wow, the are really delicious. My family loved them And they were very easy to make. I used butter instead of margarine in the dough. Also I had only about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese so I used it and made regular frosting with milk. Came out perfect. This recipe is amazing! I’ve made many cinnamon rolls in my 34 years of baking and this one is one of the best. I wanted a more airy baked dough, but our temperature/weather is very cold and dry right now with zero humidity. I’m going to try this recipe again when the weather is better. I probably should’ve made the rising time longer to fix that. Five stars though, even with the heavier dough! It was great! My fiancé loved them. Will be making these again. I mixed all the filling ingredients together and found it difficult to easily spread this over the dough. Maybe my butter wasn't soft enough. Rolled from the 21"" edge and accidentally cut these 1.5 inches and got 14 rolls. Next time I'll cut them 1.75"" for 12 rolls. Baked at 350 degrees for 22 minutes, and had to push down the popped up parts once during baking.. Only used about half of the icing and found that this is plenty enough. Alot of work, but super yummy! This recipe is amazing. Would make again! These are fantastic and easy to make. I assembled the cinnamon rolls the night before and refrigerated them. The next morning I preheated the oven to 350 and baked them for 25 minutes, uncovered. I left them in the oven, turned it off and opened the door while I made the frosting. Before frosting them I flipped them over onto parchment paper. These are delicious and easy to make. Thank you for sharing your recipe! I’ve made these numerous times. While I often alter recipes, this one is perfect just the way it is! They come out perfect every time! ?? Have made these for the last 3 Christmas' . Highy recommend using real salted butter instead of margarine. Also use bread flour . I make the dough the night before. Put in frige overnight. Take out at least 3 hours before you plan to cook to let rise. So soft and goey always a huge hit! Should come with a warning label. You will be ask to make them all the time! I make these for my neighbors at Christmas time and now all of my neighbors want the recipe!! They're amazing!! I Dank recipe! I am an experienced cinnamon roll maker, and these are the best I’ve made so far! Delicious! My family loved these. Instead of using cream cheese for the icing I made a simple vanilla icing from powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. These are so easy, even without a bread machine! So good too, I wouldn’t say they’re much like Cinnabon, but still very delicious Amazing and sooooo flavorful. Too much icing...I made about which was mote than enough. I put the dough wih a pot of hot water in the oven to speed up the rise so we could eat them within breakfast time. Took still 2 hrs before we could enjoy them. Might have used a pinch more flour because it was very stickt dough to handle even with a dusting. So close to, if not better than, Cinnabon!! Best cinnamon roll recipe out there. You gotta try these!!! I cut the roll in half, let 1/2 roll rise to double and then freeze it along with 1/2 the icing. It holds well in the freezer and they bake up great!! I did what you did and they were great! Delicious!!!!!!! Best cinnamon roll ever!!!! This was my first attempt at making cinnamon rolls. My first attempt was okay, but the second batch turned out perfectly. Thank you to the person who provided instructions for those of us who do not own a bread machine. Fortunately for me I do have a KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook. Followed the recipe exactly except I dissolved the yeast in the warm milk and manually started the dough vs using a bread machine. These were absolutely delectable and the double batch disappeared in a flash when I took them to a family event. Great recipe! Great recipe and its delicious I loved this recipe and so did everyone else who was able to taste the goodness! I will be making this again in the future! Absolutely amazing!!! I made them the night before and let them rise before putting in the fridge and cooking in the morning. I will definitely be making again. I thought they tasted just like Cinnabon. My mother said better. It is the first cinnamon rolls i have ever made  they are great this is a favorite of my Scout troop every time I have made it. mouth watering delicious It was delicious! These are unbelievable. They are as good as Cinnabon!!! My bread machine isn't big enough to accommodate this recipe, so I made in my kitchen aid with the dough hook. I let the dough hook do it's thing for about 5 minutes and then let them proof in my oven (proof setting) for an hour. After I made the rolls I refrigerated until morning then put them back in the oven on Proof for an hour before baking them. I ended up having to bake for 20 minutes, but I turned the oven down to 350 degrees for the last 5 minutes. Awesome recipe for buns. I liked this recipe- it was easy to make. It took less flour than was indicated in the recipe and dough took a long time to rise (I don't have bread machine). I also put less conf. sugar in the frosting- 1 1/2 cup makes the frosting way too sweet!
Finished product was very tasty and dough came out light and airy. Everyone loved it. If you love soft and fluffy cinnamon rolls with the perfect amount of caramelized sugar and cinnamon goodness inside, give this recipe a try! I followed it exactly as written, and the only change I made was to restart the dough cycle after kneading so it had two rounds of kneading. The dough came out perfectly hydrated and smooth. Getting the dough to flatten out to the right size was a challenge because the gluten kept pulling it back, but some gentle stretching and resting worked wonders. All in all, if you follow this recipe as stated you will not be disappointed. I doubled the margarine in the dough by accident, and these still turned out phenomenally. Mine needed an extra 10 minutes in the oven though. Next time, I'd reduce to 375 so they don't get so dark too. Anyone who says these are nothing special must have done something wrong. They are so fluffy, soft, and gooey! I think Clone of a Cinnabon is a misnomer - everyone who ate one said they are BETTER. I did use my Zojirushi bread machine for the dough, letting it rise in there for an hour or so because my house is cold. It was a bit of a pain to roll the dough out all the way, but 100% worth it. The only thing I did differently is that I used butter instead of margarine in the dough because that's what I had. After getting the rolls in the pan, I had to improvise for the second rise since my oven doesn't have a proof setting and its lowest temp is 170. I turned the oven on to the lowest temp for 10 minutes and then shut it off and propped the door open. Then I covered the rolls with a kitchen towel and set them in there (with the door propped open) until they had doubled in size again. Pulled them out, heated the oven up to temp and baked. I just finished eating a leftover one from the batch I made yesterday and they reheat (15 seconds in the microwave) BEAUTIFULLY. These are amazing and so easy. I use my bread machine to make the dough and it is soft, tender and delicious every single time. With the bread machine I use warm water and dry (instant milk) 1/4 cup of the powder. MAKE IT THANK ME LATER Perfection! I’m a skeptic of copycat or clone recipes but was hard core craving Cinnabon and the closest is 3+hours away so I tried this and boy am I happy I did. The frosting is perfect! And the rolls so gooey and delicious. Yes! I craved these all through my pregnancy, so I spent a lot of time at the local mall. I can now make them at home and eat them until I look pregers. I did bake them @ 350F in the convection for 20 mins. They came out perfect. Yum! Thanks Marsha (I think) I made this as is. What would have made it better was the missing ingredient: heavy cream. After the second rise, slowly pour warm cream over and around the rolls and then bake. This causes the sugar to be more gooey rather than grainy. It also creates the gooey caramel sauce. Another thing about this recipe for beginner bakers...do not be tempted to add more than 4.5 cups of flour. The dough should be tacky but not sticky. When you’re doing your first prove, lightly grease the bowl so the dough doesn’t stick and cover with a towel or wax paper. I preheated the oven to 200F, turned it off immediately, and did both proves in the oven. Prove until it’s doubled in size...about 30-45 minutes. Over proving will make the dough airy. Bake at 375 for 20-27 minutes. This recipe is perfect in every way! If you follow the recipe and use the ingredients suggested, you won't go wrong! And yes, it will save you a lot of money if you are a regular Cinnabon visitor. Delish - thanks for the recipe! Easy to make and taste just like Cinnabon This is perfection! I had never baked rolls before and these were really wonderful. I made a few changes after reading the reviews: I don’t own a bread machine so I made these on my KA using the hook. I weighed my flour (22 ounces) and a bit more since it seemed the dough needed some extra (1/4 c approximately). For the filling, I only used half and it seemed perfect for us. I also added 1/2 C chopped pecans and sprinkled them on half of the extended dough so I got half of them with pecans and half without. We all thought the ones with pecans were better. For the frosting I used Raskas cream cheese and had to add some (2 T aprox) greek yogurt since it was really dense. Baked at 350 F for 30 minutes, 2 pyrex with 7 rolls each. After taking them out of the oven, I turned them over, frosted and put them back into the oven (turned off) to keep them warm. They were a BIG hit at home! Thank you for a fantastic recipe! Will NEVER by Cinnamon Rolls from Cinnabon AGAIN!!! Simply the best Cinnamon Rolls I have tried and I tried a lot. Thank you for this recipe. Fantastic cinnamon roll. Worked great doing the dough in a bread machine. We made it exactly as it is written but it turned out dry and crumbly so we end up doubling the cinnamon filling. They taste very good with the extra filling. We make these every holiday for breakfast and they are amazing!! The only thing I felt I needed to change was when I'm baking these in a glass casserole dish, I bake them at 375 degrees for 20-25 min. They tend to bake better. We don't live in a high altitude climate, so that's not why, but they always seemed to be underdone at 400 degrees. Otherwise, I don't change a thing!! I put more cream cheese in the recipe which made the icing less sweet and more creamy. I love these cinnamon rolls and since I only had one left after our party, I think the whole family enjoyed them too! Definitely will make these again and again. Dough did not rise following the directions as written. There is a much better an easier recipe on AR that’s uses vanilla pudding in the dough and those are by far the most amazing. So yummy! Instead of cream cheese frosting I used a glaze/ icing with melted butter, milk, vanilla and powder sugar and it was so good! Made this today exactly as directed. My first attempt wasn't elegant, but they more than made up for it in taste. Excellent recipe! I have been making these cinnamon rolls for years. It's a family favorite! Amazing and a family favorite! Better than Cinnabon. My family puts chopped up candied pecans on theirs. Yummy yummy yummy The cinnamon buns were amazing! I would just recommend baking it at 350° because my tops got cooked wile the bottom was very doughy. Awesome! I don't need to go to Cinnabons anymore. Next time I'm going to throw in some boiled raisins! Great recipe! The only change I made was I used coconut milk from a can instead of milk because, wouldn't you know it, I ran out of milk just before baking this. They were great with just the slightest hint of coconut. This is the only recipe I use for cinnamon rolls! They are absolutely amazing every single time! They turned out great and we're delicious! We did follow a few reviews that suggested baking at 350 for 20min and immediately frosting the Cinnamon rolls with half the frosting fresh out of the oven then using the rest after they cooled. I made this with soy milk and vegan butter for my boyfriend and he loved it! The rolls turned out really soft and nice the 2nd time I made it. I think allowing the yeast  warm milk to mix and bubble (about 10 mins) helped, before adding all other ingredients into bread machine. 

I would halve the sugar in the filling. Even 3/4 cup made it too sweet This is a very good base cinnamon roll recipe, the real tricks to make this a Cinnabon copy; This is the best cinnamon roll recipe. Everyone raves every time I make it. I don’t use the bread maker, I use one of the reviewers notes to make it with my stand mixer. I wouldn’t change a thing, this is my go to,?out this world perfect cinnamon roll recipe. Yummy in the tummy. ",1,19.666666666666668

I also use a hamburger and spicy sausage combo for that extra little kick. Freezing the cabbage makes the leaves so tender and easy to roll up when they defrost. I quadruple the sauce to have enough for the mashed potatoes to go with the rolls. My Polish husband says these are better than his Polish mom's recipe. I can't think of a better compliment than that! Definitely a keeper. I hate it when someone starts their rating with ' I changed some ingredients.... ' but I had to out of necessity and it really wasn't much of a change anyway. I used less brown sugar, diced, canned tomatoes instead of sauce and I probably didn't use enough salt ( I am sensitive to salty foods)---that being said they turned out great! This recipe took some of the trepidation out of making cabbage rolls, so 'Thanks for that BJ!' Since you just want the cabbage leaves to wilt, just freeze the whole head overnight and thaw it in the morning. The leaves are all wilted, no cooking needed! Not much of a cabbage fan, but this was delicious. I used a can of Ro-tel tomatoes instead of sauce (we like more spicey), and omitted the sugar. I also baked covered at 350 for 1 hour. Flavor is good. Needed more sauce. It's a good tasting recipe, but I prefer to make it the way my mother made it. It was a bit sweet for my taste, using the Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. I think it should be more savory with the a bit of the sugars developing from the onions being sweated. The cabbage is also sweet if a bit of the blanching water is added to the tomato sauce. Then salt, PAPRIKA, and some lite sprinkling of fresh herbs...even a little Italian seasoning works, or terragon and oregano. I'm not used to the lemon, but the acid does help to develop sugars when there is not sugar added. This recipe is good in a pinch. Looked more like Rotel diced tomatoes instead of tomatoe sauce in photo of cabbage rolls. I used the Rotella and it was delicious. Better than any cabbage rolls I have made or eaten. This was pretty good. I'm always up for trying food made differently. Still end up going back to our own. Try putting some sour krout,in your sauce it cooks I! I followed the recipe for the most part, but added 1teaspoon of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the sauce. Loved it All I did differently was to add 1t. Of oregano to stuffing mix. Have tried several cabbage roll recipes that I did not like but this one is a winner...finally! I see why this recipe is so well-reviewed. We used ground turkey instead of ground beef and were worried it would be dry, but it was EXCELLENT. Like other reviewers, we opted for baking covered at 350 for an hour instead of the slow cooker. We also cored the cabbage head and boiled it, pulling each leaf off at a time. I thought this would be a drag but it was quite easy! Definitely will make again. It’s very good. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was you should double the sauce, the lack of sauce caused the edges to stick and got kinda burnt, plus I like extra sauce. Other than than excellent. Will make again. Just the right level of sweetness. I make dinner for friends once a week and they all loved this one. I think I will be making it again when I need a great slow cooker meal in the future. I always lived my mom's cabbage rolls but she didn't make them often so when my hubby said he too loved them, I went looking for a recipe. This one is really, really good. I followed the recipe with the only exception being that I used Swerve brown sugar replacement since we are both diabetic. He loved them, said they were just how he remembered when he was a kid. I am making them again in a few days but doubling the amount. The recipe called for 1 1/4tsp of pepper, I used 3/4 teaspoon. Wow. It was still way too much. Pepper is all you can taste. Ironically, the tomato sauce was bland. I will stick to other recipes, this one is a bit of a disaster. Delicious. I doubled and used 1 lb pork with the 1 lb beef. Double the sauce. Baked 350 1 -1/2 hour. I also steamed the cabbage to soften and loosen the leaved prior to stuffing. Could have used two heads since I double the recipe. This is a really good recipe. I like the flexibility of making this dish using the crockpot. I did make a few minor changes just based on my family's preferences. To the meat mixture, I added 1/2 lb of ground pork to the ground beef, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and reduced the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. The sauce is great as is, but I did double the recipe which was the perfect amount for us. Like others, I cored the cabbage head then dropped the whole thing in boiling water. The leaves cook a couple minutes, then fall off the head. Take them out as they cook and seperate from the head. I cut some of the thickness off the center spine of the leaf to make it easier to roll. Use about 1/4 cup of the meat mixture per leaf and roll them up. (To roll up, place the 1/4 cup of meat near the bottom of the leaf by the large spine. Roll the bottom of the leave over the meat, fold in the leaf on each side, then roll the whole thing over to the end of the leaf) By the time you're done with the first few leaves, the next couple will be ready. Keep rolling a few at a time and you're done before you know it. This time I even stuffed the small leaves which are the perfect size for our little ones to try. Use the rest of the small pieces to sprinkle over the top of the dish. Pour over all the sauce and let it cook in the crockpot for 9 hours. Thanks for a great recipe! I’ve been using this recipe for years now and everyone always compliments me on it. Somehow I always forget it’s a crockpot recipe and tonight I cooked it in the oven at 350 for 1 hour covered. Turned out great! Easy to make. To get cabbage leaves off the cabbage, cut out the core and throw the whole cabbage in the boiling water for the 2 minutes to soften the leaves. double the sauce (but not the sugar!) and add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the meat mixture. also, boil the cabbage for just over a minute. Hit the spot! I added a small can of tomato paste and used uncooked minute rice in the filling. Also I doubled the sauce just as a personal preference. We aren't fans of the sweet and tangy sauce. Just a personal preference. Easy to make. Will use an Italian style sauce next time. Kind of like stuffed green peppers but with cabbage. Great recipe! And here, I'll make your life so much easier: microwave whole head of cabbage on high for 10 min instead of boiling it, cut leaves from stem on bottom and on deconstruct your cabbage - one leaf at the time (starting on top of a head). Great easy recipe. Except it lacked one important ingredient: garlic! Also, no need to double the recipe, as 12 rolls fit into the bottom of the crockpot perfectly. 8 hours and they were beautifully done. Highly recommend. This was delicious - made it as per recipe with exception of following the suggestion of one reviewer about placing the head of cabbage in the freezer. So easy! I put it in before I went to bed and got it out and put it into a strainer this morning. Once defrosted the leaves were wilted and pliable just as if they had been booked without the hassle. Great recipe - the meat is the right firmness and the sauce is just right. Delicious meal with mashed potatoes! Yes, we really enjoyed these. I did half the recipe (since we are only two) but kept the sauce as the recipe was written but ended up doubling that! The sauce is really what gives it flavor. Next time I make them I will double the sauce and am actually thinking of mixing some sauce in with the meat mixture. Thank you BJ! Very tasty. Needs a bit more auger to surpress the acidity Yummy! Whatever you do, don’t freeze the cabbage. I did this thinking I could save some time. Granted the leaves cane right off and were easy to roll, they didn’t cool well. They were tough!!! You shouldn’t need to saw through cabbage with a knife. I’ll know better for next time. Just needed to make an extra 25 percent sauce otherwise it would have been too dry. Make sure to add seasonings to the meat mixture. This was a simple to make. I changed it up a little by changing the ground beef to ground chicken (more healthier). I also made a Mexican Verizon by using ground turkey with black beans, sweet peppers and using a package taco seasoning as the filling and replacing the tomato sauce mixture for green enchilada sauce. Perfect....Just like my momma used to make! I sort of made this my own but we really enjoyed this dish! Trying to keep with the recipe, I used 1/2 lb Beyond Meat for the ground meat, cooked wild rice for the white rice and kept the sauce amounts as originally called for....adding garlic powder to the meat mixture per reviews. I also used a suggestion of adding a layer of drained sauerkraut to the top which was fantastic! Baked in the oven covered at 350* for an hour then uncovered for another thirty minutes. Made 7 cabbage rolls, served with garlic-horseradish mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. WOW! thank you! Really juicy making this in the slow cooker. Not dry at all. I added cabbage leaves to the bottom of the batch, in-between the cabbage rolls and on top. Followed suggestions. Doubled sauce by adding a can of diced tomatoes , added garlic and cut black pepper in half. Excellent! I made per instructions but added a little garlic powder and paprika to the meat. I think next time I would use 16oz of tomato sauce. We like sauce! Very god. I think my husband ate 4 of them. Also was easy to make. Please be sure to DOUBLE the sauce. It’s has a great taste but, can be DRY if you don’t DOUBLE sauce. I might have gone a little heavier on the onions, and instead of using a crock pot, I used my Pressure Cooker, cooking for 60 minutes. This recipe is an absolute winner in our home! Cabbage rolls can be on the tame side of taste, and this recipe carries on the tradition. Could use more salt and more tomato sauce. Oh, and more taste. I made this like the recipe stated just added some garlic and I baked it @325 for around 45 minutes until a least 165 degrees. I put some of the extra leafs on top so it wouldn’t dry out. It turned out great. I’ll be making this again Thanks for the recipe The recipe is fine, other than your suggestion to use extra lean ground beef. Cabbage rolls is not a diet food, and the fat [and flavor] is an essential component of the dish. Great flavor. Easy to cook. Excellent . Tastes like my mom used to make. And I loved it, It was really delicious. The only change I made was to add a small can of tomato paste with the sauce for a little more tomato flavour. Loved this recipe. But, adding garlic and a third cup of tomato juice to the sauce mixture is what made it really pop for me. The sauce itself and that much brown sugar is a little too sweet and acidic for my tastes. Yummy and easy. Perfect with no change. Second time I did add half pound hamburger; half pound pork sausage instead of one pound of hamburger, red pepper flakes along with garlic powder. Double the sauce is great advice. Keeper recipe for sure:) Followed the recipe and it came out really well. Cabbage leaves got a little dark as they were not covered totally by the sauce which I will increase next time.
It's a keeper. I loved the taste and the ease of this recipe. However, I did not have time to use the slow cooker, so I simply cooked it in the oven. I had a small cabbage from our garden that had very tight leaves, so I cut out the core and boiled it whole until I could peel the leaves apart. Then I boiled all the leaves a little longer. The small inside leaves I used too, by cutting them up and placing them in the bottom of the pan to help prevent any sticking or burning (as suggested in another review). I will use this recipe again as it turned out so well, even the rice worked out! This recipe ""uncomplicated"" making Cabbage rolls and would recommend it to anyone who has had difficulty before or making them for the first time. I add grated parmesan cheese for the filling for thickness. Recipe very helpful.

 R. Winn boiled the whole cabbage and peeled off the leaves. Also, used brown rice and didn't even notice the difference. Double the sauce and baked for 1.5hrs at 350. Turned out perfect! I found the meat mixture did not have enough seasoning for me. i will use this as my base and add my own seasonings next time. i also found the sauce more on the sweet instead of savory side, so i will change that as well. recipe not bad but for me tweeks are necessary. Everyone loved it. Used purple cabbage for color and milder taste Will definitely make again. Thank goodness I doubled this recipe I knew my husband and family would love it! Not exactly like Oma’s but very close. This recipe is good, easy-to-make and healthy. If you have never made stuffed cabbage before, I recommend starting with this recipe for your first time. Then modify it to your taste each time thereafter.

For myself, I found the meat to be drier than I prefer. So I switched to 80/20 ground beef and used uncooked rice which absorbed the juice. You can also use a ground beef/ground pork combination for even more flavor. I reduced the pepper to 1/2 tsp instead of 1 1/4 tsp. There wasn't enough sauce to cover all the cabbage rolls in the CrockPot. So I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce. It was the perfect amt the second time around. I used uncooked quinoa but otherwise kept the recipe the same. I had never used hamburger this way in a slow cooker and it turned out great - nice flavor and texture. Will do this recipe again. I loved it. I used a crock pot and it was DELISH! But I will try baking this time Added a half pound of sausage and some garlic powder along with a little Italian seasoning and extra tomato sauce. Think even more tomato sauce would be better. Added four ounces more this time. 
Generally yummy and will make again. I would definitely make this again. I will use more cabbage next time - it adds to the juiciness. I will also add more sauce. My family loves this recipe. For myself and my family this recipe fell short. No flavor at all. For myself and my family this recipe fell short. No flavor at all. I thought this recipe was delish! Even my husband, who is a Southern Chinese and usually finds my western food disgusting, ate it up and asked for more. 

I would say you def need to double the sauce and topped with bacon in the crock pot. I believe the bacon added a delightful smoky flavor. My husband favorite Husband loved it. Best I have tasted. I added a few more spices to the sauce with wine and also added bacon to the filling. Very good though! I cut the cabbage at the stem and peeled off and boiled only the leaves I was going to use, there was enough meat mixture to make a little more than 12, I also tripled the sauce, it turned out great and seemed to taste even better as left overs . Awesome! ! I actually did not like these at all. I did them in the slowcooker but it almost tasted as if the tomato sauce that was on top had burnt. I did add extra per other reviews but I also see that alot of those people cooked them in the oven and not slowcooker. will try oven next time. Decent recipe but it won't make enough sauce. I tripled it and it was barely enough... I would search for better cabbage rolls recipes out there, this one is very average. Almost as good as the stuffed cabbage my Lithuanian grandmother used to make. I have always loved cabbage rolls, but never made them. I did what others said to do in their reviews, doubled the sauce and also added petite diced tomatoes. Other than that I followed the recipe. I was sure that my husband was going to say that he did not care for it, but he actually loved it. Now, he normally does not eat left overs, but ate more cabbage rolls for lunch the next day. This is a winner. I made the healthy version, with ground turkey and brown rice. I added extra veggies to the meat (shredded carrot and diced celery), followed other reviews' suggestions to double the tomato sauce, and baked at 350F for 1.5 hours. They came out so good! I've long wanted to recreate this family favorite that my Polish Grandmother used to prepare, but unfortunately never wrote down. After considering all of the suggestions and testing more than a few, I settled on the following, which produced a dish that closely mirrored that which I remembered and received a unanimous thumbs-up from the family! (My apologies to those from whom I borrowed ideas without proper credit.) 

#1 Instead of boiling peeled leaves, I recommend that you, “Get a very large pot of water and bring up to a small boil; as you're waiting for the water to boil core the cabbage head with a fairly wide margin at the top and take off the outer leaves that are dirty. Once the water is hot, place the cabbage head into the boiling water. Once the outside leaves start to separate from the head, remove to a dish or bowl and check that the stem area is soft and pliable. Depending on the cabbage, you may need to help the peeling process along. “

#2 I cooked the rice in water with 2 beef bouillon cubes added to it. (don't add extra salt to the meat mixture though.) To the meat, I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and increased the onion to a whole medium. (My family are big onion fans.) This increase turned out well and didn't overwhelm.

#3 I replaced the 8 ounces of tomato sauce with two 29-ounce cans of No Salt Added, Crushed Tomatoes and doubled the remainder of the sauce ingredients. Good but I think if i make it again I would double the sauce. These were delicious! I listened to another reviewer and did half sausage/half lean ground beef and would do this again! We were able to double the batch using a full head of cabbage, so that was perfect. Honestly, I doubled the sauce, like a lot of people were suggesting, and this seemed like a waste. There was way too much sauce this way and we ended up throwing most of it away after dinner. I will make it again but with a lot more seasonings I added a can of tomato soup to the sauce, it needed a little more liquid. It turned out perfect, delicious and i will make it this way again. I made this but used many of the helpful tips from subscribers; made more sauce, used a combination of tomato soup and tomato sauce, added some of the tomato soup to the meat mixture. Also sauteed onions before putting into the dish and also used some ground pork. I appreciate the guidance from this recipe and other subscribers. The dish was pretty good and hubby appreciated the effort. Good and easy. I think next time I’m going to add some Cajun spice. Needed something It was pretty good, but we thought it was very bland for us. Next time I might try to add some more spices and maybe some garlic to the meat mix Delish...double the sauce and boil the whole cabbage head and remove leaves as they soften. The freezer method makes tough cabbage...not pleasant. I followed to recipe but I add seasoning and minced onion and a dash of garlic while I cooked the ground beef to add more flavor to the beef I will make this again. I made enough for two meals and froze it and the sauces I will be cooking this in the oven at 350 like one review said instead of the crock pot. Not one of my favorites. Very very yummy! Will be making this again sometime soon. I made just a small adjustment and doubled the amount of sauce/brown sugar/lemon juice. Had enough sauce to pour over some boiled potatoes to go with the cabbage rolls. Delicious! Thank you! I did not use lemon. I doubled the sauce. By using one can of tomato sauce and 8oz of marinara because I did not have any more tomato sauce. I sprayed my Crock-Pot with cooking spray. Then ladled one scoop of sauce on the bottom it did not stick. Everyone loved it my neighbors , my boyfriend and my son and I. I'll definitely make it again. 
The sauce did not taste good when trying it before it was cooked, I was worried. But after cooking it was delicious. The recipe is really good-my personal favorite has beef and pork and sauerkraut. I added 1/2 t garlic powder  only put in 1/4 t pepper. I will definitely make this recipe again. This is such a simple and tasty dish. I added a little bit of vinegar to the sauce to give it a tangy taste. My family loves this. Been making these for years and the only change is the topping I use is with sauerkraut and diced carrots/celery and then tomato sauce on top. very good recipe Loved it. Followed recipe even though I thought there wasn't enough liquid, and I was right. Tasted like it was missing something and it was dry. This was fantastic! The only change I made was to QUADRUPLE the sauce (as other commenters recommended). My husband always complains stuffed cabbage is too bland, but this one isn't. He loved it! didn't leave enough time for the 8 hour cook so I did it in 5 on high in the slow cooker and it turned out fine. Oh! added some chili flakes for some kick. turned out amazing. Added a pinch of brown sugar to meat mixture.Sometimes tomato recipes can be a bit acidic. My husband really liked these cabbage rolls. I quadrupled the sauce as the other reviews noted. I revised the sauce slightly by adding 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce  a little onion powder. I also added some granulated garlic to the hamburger  rice mixture. Next time, I'll add some chopped parsley to the meat mixture for some color. I made an extra pan of rolls for my freezer. Thanks for the recipe. Very delicious. The only changes I made was doubling the sauce recipe and adding a half teaspoon of garlic powder to the meat. I didn't think change nothing and a I most definitely make again no I added garlic and fresh parsley to the meat mixture. I doubled the sauce too. Really delicious. I will be making again. ",0,26.0

Thank you for sharing I made this recipe as it was written. It turned out perfect. My wife doesn't like cheese (Especially Swiss Cheese) and she loved it. I will definitely be making this again. I made it exact and it was very well received. I think if you are just starting out cooking this is a great confidence builder and a good weeknight dish. Use thin cut swiss to help roll tightly. I think I will try this with Italian breadcrumbs or panko. Loved this. Since my daughter doesn't like Swiss cheese, I made hers with gouda, which was delicious. I also used a,somewhat sweeter white wine, and it worked great. This is the best! I call it Magic Sauce. We are going to have it on steak tonight. Husband wants it on everything! Great recipe! The gravy is so good! This came out perfectly and my husband and I both loved it! Will definitely make it again! I have made this many times. It's amazing and the sause has a wonderful flavor. My family LOVES this recipe. I accidentally grabbed cayenne pepper once instead of Paprika. It turned out amazing too! Other then that one time mishap, I make this exactly as the recipe is written. I serve it with fettuccine noodles or mashed potatoes and I often will double the sauce part. So Good! Try it you'll Love it! I only made two pieces of chicken so had to cut ingredients by 2/3's it came out great looked just like the video. Must have been beginners luck. Excellent ! Made for a dinner with friends and got rave reviews. They especially loved the sauce. I bought pre-butterflied breasts and slightly pounded them out for ease. I will definitely be making this again. Make this when I need to get in my wife's good graces. It is classic yet simple to make. I substitute gruyere for swiss whenever possible for an added zing. Family loves this recipe! Really yummy sauce for sure. Will be making again 👍 It was excellent but the sauce did not come out. Will have to try again. I used some panko bread crumbs with the flour and paprika which made the breading tasty. Sooooooo Delicious!!! I spread some Grey Poupon on the chicken and added button mushrooms with the wine and bouillon. Used a chicken bouillon cube and Publix brand cooking wine. Served with buttered green beans. Absolutely amazing flavor layered throughout. Huge payoff to minimal effort. I made this yesterday, it turned out wonderful  very delicious. I also finished the chicken in the oven and made the sauce separately as others recommended. Poured the sauce over the chicken and popped it back in the oven for 10 minutes before serving. My picture was taken today of the refrigerated left overs because I didn’t take a picture before serving. Not much I’d change at all. The chicken was super juicy and perfect Absolutely an amazing recipe! Even my boys loved it and said over and over how good it was!!! Only changes i made was after browning the chicken I placed them in a 350 oven and cooked them for 15-20 minutes then added them to the sauce and simmered for 10 mins. I doubled the sauce recipe except the butter and added fresh basil!! Basil added a nice touch Terrific! Next time I’ll cook a little less (think my chicken was thinner than what recipe called for). Sauce was awesome. I did add a touch of poupon mustard, but other than that-stuck to the recipe. Definitely a keeper! I added more wine, ghee instead of butter and cheddar instead of swiss (was out). Hubby, SIL  I loved it. I can see why the 5 stars!!! This was terrific! This was an easy recipe and was very tasty. I did adjust it down to 4 servings and used an electric skillet.. it was delicious. this simple easy recipe is just great never had one better tasty, easy to prepare. This one was a winner. I have been looking for this recipe for years! This is the recipe from an old Betty Crocker recipe book. Over the years I’ve had other chicken Cordon Bleu’s, but I can always remember the taste and yummyness of this recipe. Thank you for sharing! This is a common recurring recipe in our house. The sauce is absolutely perfect!! Definite must have! I have made this so many times over the years. You won’t regret it! This is an amazingly simple but luxurious recipe. My husband really loved it. That’s my litmus test. My family loved this. Awesome recipe. I found it easier to keep the chicken after rolled together with cooking string. Held together better than toothpicks which slip through while browning. Highly recommend. I have made Chicken Cordon Bleu in the past, but not with a sauce. This sauce was delicious. Received lots of raves from my son and father. Will definitely be making this again. very tasty This was my first try at this recipe. Beautifully rolled and browned the chicken--and it was perfect! However, had some issues with the sauce ( curdling / turning very brown ); and after some creative work, I managed to save the sauce from ruin. So my next time with this recipe, I'll be looking into separately making a yummy Cordon Bleu sauce. This recipe turned out great. Even my husband raved about it and he is not a big fan of chicken. I will definitely make this again. The only thing I add to this dish is a stick of fresh rosemary to the chicken/sauce while it simmers. I take it out when I take the chicken out before finishing the sauce. This dish is worth making for the sauce alone (though it is all really good) and I will often make fresh pasta to toss in the sauce as a side. One word “Fabulous” very easy to make step by step video was easy to follow. Everyone loved this dish. Thanks for sharing. The only thing I changed was I put 2 sliced cheese  5 slices Black Forest ham I found butterflying the breast worked well for me. Allowed to roll up easily. Also seasoned the inside with salt, pepper, dash of cumin and a little rosemary not too much. Try different cheeses too. Perfected wine is Carharrt Sauvignon Blanc to cook with and to share with the meal. Soooo delicious! The sauce put it on another level. However, it also put it on a ""not very healthy"" level, but it was worth every bite! Very good, would definitely make again. The family loved it!! Gourmet all the way Love this!!! It is way better smoked over a grill!!!! pepperoni is another thing my family love to add into it !!!! You will be a French Chef when you finish making this meal. It is excellent! I didn't have chicken boullion, so I used a teaspoon of French Onion soup mix instead. While I prepared the meal for two, I would strongly suggest you make all of the sauce as if you were serving six because the two of us wolfed down the entire meal in one sitting. The sauce is over the top and sure to wow! :-) Great tasting recipe. I doubled the sauce and bouillon and cooked the chicken without the cheese and ham. At the end of the cooking I added the ham and cheese on top of the chicken until the cheese melted (I am terrible at wrapping them in the chicken). Very delicious recipe and one of my favorites! I am NO cook, but the step by step directions made it so easy!!! My 17 year old son said it’s the best thing I’ve ever made! It was all eaten before I could even take a picture!! Great video and Great recipe! Cooking chicken in frying pan instead of baking in oven is key to keeping it moist. This recipe is a family favorite! It’s one of the only dishes, outside of the dreaded chicken nuggets and pizza, that my kids will regularly ask for. My 7 year old will even eat it for breakfast the next day if I let him! The only differences to the original recipe I make is, I double the sauce, add some seasoned salt to the flower mixture, pound out the chicken until thin, and instead of folding the chicken over once stuffed, I roll it up. I also recommend using a thin sliced Swiss cheese as its makes for just the right ratio of cheese to ham, in my opinion. You have to try this one! This was delicious! The only suggestions i have, would be to season the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika on both sides before you roll it up and to make sure the chicken is pounded or cut very thin so you don’t end up with the raw chicken on the inside of the roll. Overall a simple and delicious recipe. I have made this for my family several times and it is a hit! Loved this recipe! Followed it except stuffed the cheese and sliced ham inside the chicken breast. The chicken bouillon sauce at the end made it extra delicious-if it’s runny, turn up the heat a little more as you whisk! Delightful! I made it. It was really easy, chicken juicy, tender etc...the problem was sauce, followed recipe exactly. I know how to make a rue/ gravy/sauce!!! mine curdled and there was nothing I could do to recover. again chicken was wonderf Initially I thought this would be time consuming  too involved; but once I had all my ingredients ready, it was a snap. I even made extra sauce. I also didn't have the chicken bouillon granules so I just added a few tablespoons of chicken stock. It was delicious! While it was cooking I prepared a simple side dish of small potatoes  green beans with olive oil  salt to roast. This is a keeper. Food Snob Approved!! Made this the other night and followed the recipe exactly and my bf and I loved it!! So yummy, we even made mashed potatoes and used some extra sauce on the potatoes! He asked me to definitely make this again! This was excellent. I used boneless chicken thighs and provolone as I didn’t have Swiss. The sauce was excellent as well. Fabulous! It was much easier than I thought, and my husband said it was spectacular! (I agree!) Will definitely be cooking it again soon. (Lesson learned, don't use colored tooth picks, the green  red ones left ink marks on chicken, I used them thinking that way I can see them all, to remove) Sorry no photo, it disappeared too quickly, and it smelled excellent while cooking, made us even more hungry) We loved this! Thank you for sharing, I plan on making it again. This recipe is so great. I live with my son, his wife, and their 4 children ranging in age from 4 - 18 and everybody loved it. That never happens!! A few pointers: make sure you use a non-stick pan that is big enough to move the chicken around a bit when it is cooking. Also, it is a good idea to put the same amount of toothpicks in each piece even if some pieces don't need them. That way you know how many to look for. Don't change a thing, it is perfect!!
I served it with roasted carrots lightly tossed in olive oil with some seasoning and a few fresh herbs. Great combo! excellent Good recipe. Don’t think I’ll roll them up next time. This was excellent just as written. I served it with mashed potatoes. I will add be adding it to our regular rotation. Would love to add fresh mushrooms to the sauce next time. Really turned out well! Realized it’s important to make sure the ham and cheese are INSIDE the chicken so it rolls up and browns correctly. Overall VERY pleased.! Delish! Made some substitutions based on what I had on hand. Halved the butter, used white grape juice instead of wine and used heavy coconut cream instead of heavy cream. I’m sure it would’ve been just as good with original ingredients. Definitely a keeper! I have been making this recipe for several years. It’s always a huge hit! Tonight I changed it up a bit and added garlic, salt, pepper, basil, sage, and oregano to the chicken breasts before placing the ham and I used Provolone instead of Swiss and beef bouillon instead of chicken, because it’s what I had on hand. It turned out amazing, as always, just slightly different than normal. The sauce is to die for! Perfection! I modified this several ways, and it came out fantastic! First, I rolled the chicken, ham and cheese in Saran Wrap and put int the refrigerator for 30 minutes. That helps to hold the shape well before dipping into the flour mixture. Next, I added about 1/4 C plain bread crumbs to the flour, paprika and bouillon mixture for texture. I put 1 tablespoon of butter cut in even, small pieces in a baking dish, then added the white wine enough to cover the bottom. I put the chicken on top of that, then added 1 additional tablespoon of small pieces of butter on top. I cooked covered with foil for 30 minutes at 350 F, then uncovered, sprinkled lightly with grated Parmesan cheese and cooked uncovered another 20 minutes. I made a béarnaise sauce and covered with that for serving. Turned out to be the best we have ever had! Delicious!!! My husband said this was the best he has ever had! This chicken cordon bleu is amazing. I didn’t change anything to it. I’ve made it many times, much to my families delight! By far the best part of it all was the sauce. I enjoyed making it and was very easy.

(I also think I did pretty good for being a 11 year old kid) This was delish!! Even my picky 13 yr old loved it!! I did not make any adjustments to the recipe. Delicious. I seasoned chicken with salt, garlic powder and chicken seasoning first.
I also dredged in egg before coating in flour. Followed rest of recipe .
My family loved it. Will definitely be making again . I liked the recipe as is, and simmering is perfect when the cheese blends to the sauce and adds extra flavor Yum! Baked chicken after browning- poured in sauce for last 20 minutes. EXCELLENT! Made this last night for dinner .. Excellent.. Cant wait to make it again . took a little longer to make then what it said ..maybe im just slow . but it was worth it . i just did 2 chicken breasts and cut the ingredients by 1/3. The flavors were all good but this chicken is swimming in entirely too much butter then paired with that cream sauce. Next time I'll cut the butter back and add some olive oil. Not trying to make it total diet food but this was overkill fat. This was so tasty. The sauce was special with the white wine. I just needed to add some salt. My wife licked the plate.l will definitely make it again! This is one of the best recipes i have ever made. Just the sauce alone is a favorite at our house! Solid recipe! Think 'small burrito' when rolling this up (thin, symmetrical breast, all ingredients on one side, roll to the other). Cooks super quick! I used Half and half to smooth out the finish. Made exactly as directed— so good!! Thank you for the recipe. Awesome, loved every part of it. I think next time I will put two swiss cheese pieces in each breast. Entire family loved it. Sauce was amazing! THIS RECIPE IS TO DIE FOR! Only thing I switched was I used panko and Parmesan instead of bread crumbs! Followed everything else to a T! Followed a review that made sauce separately! Yummo!! I did half butter  half vegetable oil and it was still great. There isn't a lot of liquid for the sauce so I added an extra cup of water to the sauce. Made this for my family and they all gave it 2 thumbs up!!! Served it angel hair pasta and and green beans. I did make a little more of the sauce which was the best part...delicious!! We will definitely make this again Do not make changes to the recipe and post it. The recipe is perfect as it is!! Restaurant quality! I have made this recipe many times and it is always a big hit. Excellent recipe and here are a couple mods that make it a little healthier: use a little xantham gum instead of flour and cornstarch (perhaps a teaspoon for coating the chicken and a pinch in the cream sauce). Also, I used a hand blender to smooth out the sauce. This is a great recipe as is. as an alternative, I usually flour egg and bread the chicken, doubling the egg and bread on the seams and skip the toothpicks.
Also, a pat of butter and some parsley in the middle that will add a nice treat when you cut into it. I also use a chasseur sauce to finish instead of a cream sauce but any brown sauce would work. This is sooo tasty! I used bread crumbs for the crust and finished the chicken in the oven while I cooked some fresh green beans. The sauce/ gravy was delicious! Easiest Cordon Bleu recipe I've found! Made as is without changes. Everybody loved it! I don't know how I stumbled upon this recipe but it has become our family favorite, everyone loves it!! I always read the reviews and the changes we made were adding salt and pepper to the flour along with smoked paprika, rolling in the flour then dipping the chicken rolls in an egg wash and then rolling and pressing in panko bread crumbs before browning until crispy. We finished them in the oven in a uncovered casserole, 350 degrees for 30 minutes. We used a Sauvignon Blanc whine to make the sauce in the drippings and doubled the sauce recipe. The recipe is a keeper! I did not have cream...I rarely use it. I substituted Plain Greek Yogurt in its place. Very tasty! I also used Smart Balance in place of butter (due to cholesterol )...great taste! And easy to do. Took about 45 minutes total time! Will make this more often! I love this recipe my family loves it and one of my children request me to make it for his birthday. I used half and half for the sauce and it was still great. Also used Wondra flour since that is what I had. Very good dish my go to chicken Cordon Bleu recipe Love this recipe. Some changes. Brown the chicken and put in baking pan. Bake at 350 for 20 minutes. Combine heavy cream, SHERRY WINE, corn starch and bullion in sauce pan. We use Canadian bacon and mozzarella instead. I love this recipe!! This is my go to recipe for impressing a date. I made a vegetarian version which taste just like the real thing. I just swapped out the chicken and ham for plant based chicken and bacon, I couldn't find ham. I also subbed a vegetable bullion cube. First attempt and it was really really good. I wanted an easy meal and this was it. I will for sure make this again in the future. I also turned the chicken midway through the 30 mins of cooking. 

I added to the flour mix, thyme, and garlic powder. Probably would add a little salt next time. 

For the sauce, I used an inexpensive pinot grigio. I added smooth dijon and salt. The sauce was so freaking good. 

Thanks for the recipe! I've made this multiple times, and yes.....it IS the best!! Well worth the time. Delicious! I added a little bit more wine to the cream sauce mixture at the end for a full wine flavor and to extend the sauce. We really enjoyed this dinner. I made the recipe using the amounts at my discretion. I added salt and pepper to the flour and used chicken broth instead of wine. Fabulous! I loved this recipe. I regrettably did not have white wine on hand, but rest assured it still turned out great. To the sauce and the flour to coat chicken I added garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Also added Dijon mustard to the sauce. I removed the chicken from the pan after cooking (25 min) and made the sauce in that same pan. I served it with sautéed spinach and mashed potatoes and put some of the extra sauce over mashed potatoes. Really good recipe. Very yummy! ",1,34.2

I modified the recipe; I did not use Sour Cream or a cake mix but made this cake from scratch. I unfortunately, used a little too much milk. I also included raspberry filling. Overall, it was very moist. Drizzle it with dark chocolate - Yeah!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it’s one of the best cakes I’ve made. I don’t think it needs a glaze because it truly is too much chocolate. Holy Smokes! Just follow the recipe! Everybody loved it. Very pretty cake. Followed the recipe as written, came out dry. Poured cream over it and it was good then! Live at 9,000 ft elevation so had to adjust for smaller 15.25 oz cake mix and altitude. Used only 3/4 of the pudding mix and 3/4 of chocolate chips (subbed mini chocolate chips). Changed warm water to 1 cup, sour cream and oil to 7/8 c each; added 4 Tbsp all purpose flour. Baked at 325 for 55 minutes. Turned out perfectly!!! Very moist, chocolate chips perfectly distributed throughout! Fantastic rich, moist chocolate cake! Made exactly as written...the first cake is still as moist as the 1st day on day 7 (almost gone). I am now making in bulk - 12 to be exact for Christmas gifts. The only change is one will be a sugar free cake mix, and sugar free pudding, however the sugar free pudding is only 2.1oz, so making with 2 boxes. This will be a standard go to for an all around great cake! I used coffee instead of water. Everyone loved this! I reduced the chocolate chips to 1/4 cup and substituted coffee for water, as others suggested. Great recipe and a keeper. Very rich and moist! Made just a few adjustments to my liking. I used Betty Crocker Super Moist “Chocolate Fudge” 15.25 oz size. I used Chocolate Fudge instant pudding 3.9oz size. I also used 1/2 cup of oil  1/2 cup of melted butter. I also added a teaspoon of Instant coffee into the warm water. I glazed it with Betty Crocker butter cream frosting. Delicious! It will not me upload my photo! Followed the recipe except i added 1/2c. mashed bananas bc ran out of eggs. Made this with my 6 and 3 yrs old and it still came out delicious and so darn tasty, couldnt barely taste the banana flavor. I shared cake with my mom (who's extra picky) and she went in for 2nds without asking! She's also diabetic. Lol she loved it. Barely a couple days later and I'm craving for more. A week later I decided to bake another one! Saving this recipe and writing it down twice. It'll be my go to from now on! Nomore store bought death by chocolate cake... im making my own, this! Thank you for the recipe!! No changes. It was perfect! btw, I did a double take when I looked at the size of the pudding because mine was much less, BUT, that was because it was sugar-free. Turned out great! To make this into cupcakes, bake for 22 minutes. Let cool and add a dark chocolate buttercream. I’ve made this many times, in different pans and it’s always a show stopper. Moist and always delicious. Thank you for sharing. I’ve been using this recipe for 50 years or more. It’s always a hit, especially served warm with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. I usually substitute 1/4 cup Kaluha and 1/4 cup vodka plus 1teaspoonful of instant coffee granules or espresso powder for the water to heighten the flavor of the chocolate. Cake was sooooo good!!! Going to make it again... and again. I have made this cake for years and it is perfect. I have made it for neighbors and family, it is super moist. I make it in Bundt and loaf pans. How can anything be too much chocolate!! This cake is fantastic. I normally make my cakes from scratch but, for a modified box cake, this is easy and excellent. I’ve taken it to several gatherings and potlucks over the years, and it gets requested time and time again. The only thing I modify is adding a teaspoon of espresso powder to the hot water. You can’t taste the espresso, but it intensifies the chocolate flavor even more. I always use chocolate chips but brand and type (dark, semi-sweet, etc) change depending on what I have on hand. I truly don’t understand the negative reviews. Add more butter? There’s no butter in it to begin with! Follow the recipe and instructions as they are for a delicious chocolate treat! Good enough on its own, but I dust with powdered sugar for aesthetics. No icing. The best! I use mini chocolate chips and the bake time may vary by a bit, but, it’s so good! this cake turned out really bad!! IDK how or WHY it won the county fare!! I tried adding a little more butter, I baked it twice but what did it give me? I followed the recipe really well. I guess i'm not a baker. I have made this cake many times and it is phenomenal! I have tried it with peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips, applesauce instead of oil and while the changes still make a good cake, the original recipe is the best. Thank you for sharing this easy, wonderful recipe with us. needed 3/4 cup of water. Best chocolate cake ever!!!!! Super moist and good, definitely a favorite recipe These made the best cupcakes! A New Family Favorite! Followed the recipe exactly. My sister is a chocolate fanatic, and she said this was the best chocolate cake she's had in years! I have been making this cake for years. It’s always a hit. Sometimes I add chocolate icing from a can on top and sprinkles. This recipe is perfect as is. SO so Good I have been making this for years without modifications to the ingredients. I do cook it in two round cake pans and add some flare to it! I used prepackaged frosting, good name brand and fudge type. Cut up mini candy, coat the outside with mini- semi sweet chips and bring some good milk from the local dairy!! Big Win at Teacher luncheons, co workers and sold at a bake sale/fundraiser for 35$$$ This has become a family favorite! Very moist. Great recipe! Used ganache to ice and got rave reviews 👍 The name is appropriate. The texture of it was GREAT, the substitutions compared to a traditional cake work very nicely. But it was overall a little too rich and a little... too much chocolate for me! I think it would probably be good served as a small piece with some vanilla ice cream or fruit to cut through the intensity. Excellent recipe! Very moist cake Such a delicious - easy cake to make! Hubby - who is not a huge chocolate cake fan said it was one of the best desserts I have made. Whole family loved it! It's not too sweet - which I love. I was thinking of adding a frosting, but so glad I didn't. A little powdered sugar and some vanilla ice cream - perfect! The only thing I changed was I used the mini chips as that was all I had. Easy to make, was the biggest hit with Family and Friends at Christmas Party. So So Good!! Very Moist. Added Butter Cream frosting (microwaved and dripped over cake) Made a big Difference! Wow! I made a few tweaks to the recipe, but I’m impressed. I didn’t want to “cheat” and use a cake mix, but I’m not even ashamed anymore! Here are my modifications- 1/2 cup olive oil instead of vegetable oil; espresso instead of plain water; no chocolate chips; marshmallow center using a melon scooper; white chocolate drizzle with chocolate frosting to hold the strawberry garnishes. I’m going to make this for everything now. Thank you for this new staple in my recipe book. Super yummy. I followed the directions but also did a cream cheese filling to make it extra special. For Christmas I did chocolate and vanilla icing and sprinkled crushed candy canes on top with lots of edible decorations. Very easy. Very festive. This cake was ridiculous. Really good, because it was first time I'd baked a cake in at least 40 years LOL.

It's the Holidays, so stores are packed, and some things are sold out. No chocolate pudding. But I found 1 pkg. of DOVE brand's Bourbon Vanilla Dark Chocolate pudding. I had no choice......The pudding brought a very subtle bourbon flavor to the cake, but it was noticeable. I made two glazes, one chocolate, and one a vanilla bourbon, thus creating choices for children and adults (my hubby's idea).

It was a total hit. But the real beauty part is, this is a very inexpensive cake that packs a punch! I recommend thin slices because the texture is so moist and rich. Add whipped cream on the side and you're done. 

Trust me, if you make this, people will be impressed. Definitely one of the best chocolate cake I’ve ever made. It’s a winner for sure!! Made this as written, except used coffee instead of water. Use the full amount of oil! I have made this cake over and over. It’s the one my grandkids ask for all the time. It’s also wonderful for odd shaped cake pans (I have a tractor pan) as it is a sturdy cake. I make the recipe as it is and it’s perfect. It’s a lot of batter. That’s fine we get extra cupcakes along with our cake. Thank you so much for such a great recipe. This is my go-to cake with I want something good and easy Rave reviews. Very dense, moist chocolate cake. I made as directed, although I used a regular size instant pudding mix and a regular size cake mix, with no adjustment. Turned out perfect. I made this with cannoli dip on the side, fantastic! This is the best cake I’ve ever made! I love that it’s dense and moist, and the chocolate chips just add another tasty component. This is now my go-to cake and I can’t wait to make it again! O.M.G this was so good that it is all I will be baking anytime soon! Mine took an hour to bake and was so worth it. I never got around to adding powdered sugar or drizzled icing, it was perfectly delicious! I made this for a dinner at my husband's church. Super easy to make, though I used semi-sweet chocolate chunks because my store was out of chips. Cake was a huge hit! I was able to snag a small piece and it was so moist and delicious. This will definitely be my go-to cake from now on. (I forgot to take a picture but looked the same as the picture for the recipe.) I've been making a similar version of this cake as cupcakes using the smaller sized cake mixes: It only has 3/4 cup of the sour cream and oil, smaller 3.4 oz box of pudding, 3 eggs, same amount of liquid (water), plus 2 ts of vanilla extract. I make it even better by using strong brewed coffee for the water and adding 1Tb of unsweetened cocoa powder. I merged this recipe with another cupcake recipe on allrecipes and added a layer of cream cheese filling topped with cherry pie filling (omitting the chips) for a black forest bundt cake! EDIT: I felt the outside of the bundt was too crisp so next time I might do as others and cut the oil in half, add 1/4 cup milk, and bake at 335 for 55-60 mins! This recipe is phenomenal. I have made it 3 times in the past three weeks. It melts in your mouth. I have given quite a few people the recipe. My children and grandchildren absolutely love it. Serve it with or without icing! It is so easy to make, there is no reason not to make it. It smells delightful while baking like a holiday every time it bakes.
Carolyn Taylor This cake got me a husband, need I say more? Excellent cake I fell in love with. For the serious chocolate lovers only This is the most amazing cake! I don’t even like cake but I love this so much. My sister( who is a professional cake baker) and I made it exactly to the recipe. It’s perfect. Don’t change anything I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Super moist! Chocolate overdose just how I expect it!! Fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it in a flat, disposable, aluminum pan I bought at the grocery store. I did use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. So moist and not hard at all. Makes me think of all the variations I could try. Thank you for this recipe, it’s a keeper! Holy moly! I'm admittedly a bit of an anti-box-cake snob, but I was making dinner for a friend and staying in an AirBnB so my ingredients and cooking utensils were limited. I couldn't find the mini mint chocolate chips, so I ground up a couple of high quality mint chocolate bars in my blender and then added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to bring it up to 2 cups. I also cut the oil to 3/4 of a cup (because the cake mix I used was 15.25 ounces and not the 18.25 called for in this recipe). I topped it with a chocolate ganache recipe from all recipes and OH. My. God! So moist. Probably the best chocolate cake I've ever had. We both had two pieces. It is a lot of chocolate! However, it is easy to make and moist. I topped mine with powdered sugar and a chocolate ganache and added semi-sweet chocolate chips on top. Followed the recipe and did not deviate. It was too much chocolate, but I realize it was self induced...and was warned! This is a very moist, rich cake. Followed directions as listed, but did toss the chips in a bowl of flour first before adding to avoid them sinking. However, if you are doing a bundt cake, the gathering of the chips will be at the top after you flip it without the flour step and has a nice look. I will make this again and again. Delicious! My grandson asked for a chocolate cake with chocolate icing for his birthday and he received what he asked for with this cake! It was well received by everyone. It is definitely a keeper of a recipe and I am anxious to use this recipe again. (I did change the sour cream to Plain Greek Yogurt and It worked well) After reading the reviews: I used 1 and 3/4 cups mini chocolate chips, added 1/3 cup more cake mix from another box, subbed strong coffee for the water, added a splash of vanilla extract and baked at 325 for 60 minutes. I checked it at 50, 55 and 60 minutes with a toothpick. The last time, it didn’t come out clean either but I didn’t want to risk over baking it. It came out fine. I left it to cool in the bundt pan for about 2 hours- the directions said for an hour and a half but I had to run to the store to buy a cake carrier. I made it a day in advance, still very moist the second day. Dusted it with powdered sugar just before serving. One piece was left for the third day and it tasted even better. Very dense and delicious. My brother who doesn’t like sweets asked for a piece to have the next day. Turned out amazing! I only had 2 smaller boxes of sugar free chocolate pudding in the house, but that being my only This is my favorite cake! We've made this dozens of times and I adore it's rich chocolately goodness. Yesterday, I made cupcakes with this recipe for my daughter's sweet 16 birthday party and it was a big hit. It made 30 cupcakes and they were gone! Came out great! Amazing! Amazing cake!!! Nothing to change about this recipe. Everyone loved it. I’m daughter told me I needed to make this cake again (tomorrow lol). I made this cake just as the recipe called for. If I’m eating cake, I’m not looking for a diet or low calorie version. Give me the good stuff! Lol. I made this cake and it was so easy to make, and was sinfully delicious. My husband said he actually feels good after eating it! He would like me to make one a week! My jeans will be getting tight very soon. I read through a lot of reviews. It is important to note that Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines changed the standard size fo their cake mixes. The Canadian box is now 83% of the original size, so the full recipe needs to be adjusted. I used:
1 box Betty Crocker 432g
1 4-serving Jello pudding
3/4 cup sour cream
3/4 cup oil
3 eggs
 1/2 cup warm coffee
1 cup mini chocolate chips

I used a dark pan sprayed with cooking spray. It baked at Convection 325 for 55 minutes. A skewer was not clear - it probably made contact with chocolate chips. I baked another 5 minutes for safety. Let it cool for 45 minutes, and then topped with a glaze of chocolate chips, heavy cream and a little butter.

I won't say this is guest-worthy or that it replaces a home made or bakery cake, but it was tasty. I did not get the ""chemical"" taste that some reported. It really reminded me of a Tim Horton's Chocolate Glaze donut. It came together very quickly and the flavour was a good reward for the effort I put into the recipe. Will definitely make it again. I’ve been making almost this exact same recipe for over 20 years now. My grandmother got it from somewhere in the 90s (I’m guessing a newspaper or magazine). It always turns out great, and looks especially impressive when I use my rose-shaped bundt pan and dust with powdered sugar. I have given them as gifts to neighbors at Christmas before—they’re a lot easier than making multiple kinds of cookies, but they look like you really made an effort. Give it a try—you won’t be sorry. This was Fantastic!! I did what some others suggested. I swapped out applesauce for oil. Used Captain Morgan’s pecan Carmel liqueur for the water and small chocolate and peanut butter chips. Fantastic!! My husband and I couldn’t stay away from it!! This cake is delicious! Moist and so much chocolate. Very easy to make - follow directions and keep ingredients in your pantry. This was a super easy and delicious recipe. My box cake and pudding were smaller than what was listed so I just adjusted the oil and sour cream down to 3/4 cup and used 3 eggs instead of 4. So easy, so good, will definitely make again! I've been craving chocolate cake for a couple weeks but b/c I'm working overtime during the pandemic, haven't had time to bake from scratch. I thought I'd try this due to the reviews. I mixed it up exactly per recipe  tasted batter. It just tasted like artificial box cake mix w/ an instant pudding vibe. So I tried a few things I do when baking from scratch for a richer taste - bit of espresso powder, extra tablespoon of sour cream. Baked it  the top was overcooked although the rest was fine in terms of done-ness. Afterwards, we all tried it and it was a 4/4 ""no"" here. I made a chocolate ganache to pour over, hoping that would help. While it looks pretty, none of my teenagers or I care for it. Idk if a different box mix might help or using butter vs oil and milk vs water - something that often can improve box mixes. But at that point, it's basically a different recipe. Worth a shot once but not making again. This is an AMAZING cake recipe! I love its springing texture and I have found that it actually is better a day or two after its made! I used a chocolate buttercream icing for the top and added mini chocolate chips instead of big ones and it came out so great. Thanks for the recipe! The BEST chocolate cake! Love how moist and delicious this cake always turns out! I use expresso chips instead of regular chocolate chips and it gives it such a great coffee flavor! OMG! This cake is delicious and so easy! It is now my new go to for a quick delicious cake to take to functions. Loved this! I made a Irish Cream glaze to go over the top and it was amazing. Very Good...Make it every year for my birthday.... This is an awesome recipe! So delicious! I didn't have enough sour cream - only about 1/3 cup, so I substituted the rest with mayonnaise. Perfect!!
Delicious, bakery style chocolate cake!! This is an awesome chocolate cake! Made it for my son on his birthday and it was a big hit! Simple recipe and delicious cake! For a dark non-stick pan, decrease temp to 325 degrees. Loved it..I substituted milk with water. I've also saw people using coffee, bailys(?) Or adding kaula..which I would like to try next time. I originally made this cake because I thought it looked very good and am a fan of making any and all deserts! Tho, the first time I made this cake I slightly undercooked it, it’s something I seem to mess up a lot. But a had a family member who asked me to bake them a cake for there birthday so I d coded to give it another go since it was very very delicious even tho I under cooked it. After making it a second time and seeing the many reactions to the cake( also cooking it long enough ) I can say that this is a very simple and great cake to make! Th only thing that I differed with was the amount of time it had said to cool I had only let it cool for 45 minutes instead of a hour and 30 minutes. Many deserts say to allow them to cool for over an hour but I am always to inpatient to listen and only ever do it for 45 minutes and it always turns out fine. So if you need the cake done in less time it is completely fine to allow it to cool for less than an hour and 30 minutes! Oh my goodness, this was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and topped it with Satiny Chocolate Glaze. I've been looking for a very chocolate cake without strange tangs or aftertastes. This is it!
I cut the cake into 16 portions because I thought cutting it into 12 would make the portions too large. I think I should have cut it into 20. 
Thank you for a great and easy recipe! Great. It was the perfect addition for Thanksgiving dinner dessert along with sweet potato pie. Super moist and delicious. did not make any changes, will make again. easy, and tasty. but some knew it was a box cake mix....so Outstanding Chocolate Cake... high praise from a life long chocolate addict!!!
Easy to put together and bake. I had to add an additional 1/2 cup liquid, other than that made as directed.
Topped mine with chocolate rum ganache and powdered sugar.
This is now at the top of my chocolate cake list. This cake recipe is the best! It was moist and chocolaty. Everyone loved it! I’m definitely saving this one in my favorites. Delicious! I’ve made this cake many times before thou this is the first time I’ve commented on it.
I need to thank the original submitter, my grandson loves this cake so much he requests it every birthday! This is the 5th year in a row I’ve made it for him. When he was little he called it Grandma’s Donut Cake. A winner for any chocolate lover! Followed the recipe and it turned out perfect and delicious! Love it. Tried red velvet mix, white chocolate and vanilla pudding too. People who don't like red velvet love this mixed. Big hit. Thank you for the receipe. Thank you those reviewers who suggested I can do red velvet version with this receipe. I baked this cake for my daughter and her family. Her husband said, "" I don't usually like chocolate cake, but I love this! Their daughter asks for a piece every night. They commented how moist and rich it was. It was a hit! Followed the exact recipe and it came out delicious! I let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes on top of a wire rack and then cut off the excess top so it laid flat when flipped. I frosted it with a delicious satin glaze (recipe also found on this site) and it looks beautiful. It was delicious. I used regular chocolate chips. Next time I will use the mini's. The next day I put a piece in the microwave about 15 seconds and it made the chips that were still ""whole"" warm. Yummy! Speechless!!! This was incredibly decadent and yet pretty easy to make. I do not bake- but the occasion required a special dessert. Huge hit!! loved it. and so did my kids! Receipe is perfect as is. 2nd time making it, 2nd time a Winner! I made this many times and also made for family members and the just love it and so do I. I will be making this for dessert on thanksgiving. Amazing Best chocolate cake ever! I made it into cupcakes for a contest at work. I substituted coffee from Starbucks for the water and used mini chocolate chips. Using coffee cuts the sweetness a little and gives it a more sophisticated taste, but you can't really detect the coffee. I made a frosting that started with a ganache and mixed in some sour cream and then folded in whipped cream. I won the first round and then the semi-finals. I didn't get to go to the finals because my mother suddenly passed away, but I'm pretty sure I would have won the grand prize with this winner! It was great! I do think it needs some sort of drizzle. Frosting or ganache helps to lock in the moisture. I didn’t make any substitutes. ",1,16.166666666666668

It was embarrassing. I don’t knew what I did wrong, but its texture was very rubbery with a bland flavor. I brought most of it home. After letting it set for two days, the texture and flavor changed completely! It soften and had a lovely, smooth Coors flavor. We liked it!! Hence the middle of the rating. Next time, I will make it two days ahead! 🤷‍♀️ We liked this bread, except for the dominant baking soda taste. Will try again reducing the baking soda with perhaps baking powder. It's a really flexible recipe! I had some leftover ingredients from a previous bread recipe so I tossed everything in, and yet did not have to change this recipe's ingredients or procedure to compensate at all. I added bulgar wheat, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds,  caraway  it still didn't turn out too dry or anything. Excellent recipe. Followed it and used Pilsner beer since recipe didn't specify what type of beer. Bread came out very fragrant. Recipe should specify flat beer as I blended in the foam as well. But still came out very tasty. Friend gave a piece thumbs up. I’ve made this twice this month - it’s that good and easy ! I use only 3 tsp baking powder ( as others suggested) and 1/4 c brown sugar. Before baking I tip with slices of butter and sprinkle with kosher salt. It’s such a nice ‘cheater’ homemade bread, smells like a yeast bread while baking and SO quick to put together! This is a great bread and really fast and easy to make. Great flavor! This is my first beer bread. It was super easy and tasty. This was so good tasting and easy to make. I used Beck’s non-alcohol beer and followed recipe exactly. It is dense with a chewy crust . So good!! awesome recipe, thank you! used Longboard Lager, put melted butter in bottom and top before baking. baked on middle rack for 1 hour. perfection! crusty top, no bitterness. just comfy food! This was so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I also added some melted butter on top before baking. Next time I will try without the butter and see the difference. I followed the recommendation to use my kitchenaid mixer and it worked perfectly. Perfect bread recipe for anyone who’s intimidated by baking their own bread. I used pumpkin ale. I made this and the result is awesome. Used 3 cups of AP flour since that was in the house, and only 3 tsp of baking powder. Baked for 1 hour in an 8-inch cast iron pan, and it turned out great! Very easy and delicious.. definately going to be making this again and have already recommended it to several people Added 1/3 cup of unsalted sunflower seeds. Great east recipe! I was looking for a beer bread recipe since I couldn't find yeast in any stores. It seems everyone is baking these days to stay busy during the pandemic. We are self isolating so I am baking bread to give to neighbors and to keep and freeze. A very good recipe. I followed the recipe except I substituted some of the white flour for almond flour and uncooked old fashion oatmeal. Modelo beer. I used a pizza stone for baking instead of a loaf pan. It baked for 55 min at 350. Lots of nutty texture on the crust and the crumb is soft and chewy. I will make again in a few days. This bread won't last long in this house. Good texture and great flavor! I will definitely make this again! I made this because I ran out of yeast and we're limiting our grocery store trips right now. I used 3 teaspoons of baking powder as another reviewer recommended in order to avoid bitterness of too much baking powder. As a result, it may not have risen as much as it otherwise would have, but I'm not sure. It tastes really good though. I've had several slices just plain, no butter, no anything. It is sweet enough, and moist on its own. Made this with a bottle of milk stout that we did not care for and a less sugar(1/4c) It was quite good, quick and easy!
But I really like the kneading part in regular bread recipes. I just pour a little honey,melted butter,and salt on top. My husband loved it. Wiring this time of social distancing for the corona virus, this was a welcome addition to our family dinner. My four year old helped make it. We didn’t have whole wheat flour on hand, so we doubled our all purpose flour instead. It turned out great! We’re going to make it again with cheddar cheese and maybe some jalapeños! Recipe is a hit. Have made it with and without addition of melted butter (1/4 c) on top of dough before baking. It’s great either way, but the butter makes the crust so good. Like, steal the crust from you kid’s slice good. I make this when I don’t have the time or energy for yeast bread. It is so quick and easy. Tonight having it with beef stew. Yum! Yes, I added Olives in one batch, milled Cranberry and Almond in the other, to try a savory and sweet variation. It was a hit with my family. Delicious, thank you! Fantastic bread recipe! Excellent! Very simple to make - I also added melted butter to the top prior to baking. This recipe is a keeper. I’ve made this a few times. I’m trying now to cut sugar to 1/4 C. and I added 1/2 C. sunflower seeds to the dough. I also used raw oats for the topping.
Delicious! Followed recipe exactly. Used Coors beer. It was so bitter had just plain bad I had to toss it. I made this just as written with 2 Tbs. melted butter over top before cooking. Moist and flavorful! This was the perfect compliment to the Allrecipes Award Winning white chili. I followed others suggestions and brought the baking powder down to 3 tsp, added a cup of shredded cheddar and topped it of with melted butter with garlic and onion powder. Delicious! 3 cups stone ground whole wheat flour
1.5 beers
no sugar
butter on top Super simple. Easy ingredients. Had it with chicken soup. I found I did not have to mix with my hands. This was the easiest and tastiest bread! I used a combination of a Cherry Pilsner and a Lager. Also added 3 tbsp pumpkin seeds, 3 tbsp sesame seeds, 3 tbsp sunflower seeds. Brushed the top with butter before baking as many suggested. Excellent! I made this just as directed. Super easy, super quick, looked good and tasted great.
I couldn't have wanted anything more. I added some cheese on top. Very delicious and easy to make. Will definitely make it again. I've never reviewed a recipe, but this was wonderful bread! It was one of the easiest things I've made from this site. Had a luncheon serving lemon chicken soup n this bread. FANTASTIC! Followed the recipe exactly. Find we had only light beer, I tried it with hard cider, turned out great! Good bread and sooooooo EASY I had some left over Stout and an over abundance of whole wheat flour with an itch to bake. I would have given this 5 stars but found it to be a little too salty. I will cut back on the amount of salt next time. I did follow another members suggestion and did throw some unsalted butter with black pepper and thyme on the top before baking. This bread is great toasted. Oh my gosh, what an easy to make bread recipe. Also as good as was easy. My hubby homebrews his own so I made with his Rye beer. It was a bit strong for me but I still enjoyed it. Hubby really liked it but he likes rye bread anyway unlike myself. Can't wait to make this with his German Wheat beer which is my favorite. This one is a definitely a keeper. I did use only 3 tsp. of baking powder and added 4 tsp. wheat gluten as I do with all my bread baked goods. Do not use an IPA beer. Nine people having dinner were unable to eat the bread. Instead of 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white I use white-wheat flour. Add a teaspoon or so of cayenne, parsley, and garlic powder and 12 oz seltzer instead of beer. This is the best bread I've tried! Followed recipe exactly. Used really old root beer ale. Baked til 45 min. Incredibly chewy and delicious. No need for butter. How is this possible?! I will make this again. I used a summer ale and added a little sharp cheddar cheese. It looked as beautiful as it tasted. Was gone too fast to get a picture, or I'd share that. Very easy recipe to follow. This is quite a heavy bread, though very easy and tasty. I do believe it is miss-titled though. It should be called Half-Wheat Beer Bread since it is made with half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. That aside, I reduced my sale by 1/2 t. as it was suggested by another. I only had a very dark beer on hand and used that. It turned out bitter, but edible. I would suggest to only use lighter colored beers for this bread. Overall I am happy with this and would make it again, but with lighter beer. I made this with no changes to recipe- delicious. I’ll be making this my new ‘go to’ for quick bread. I made this tonight, and it turned out ok. Next time I'll cut the brown sugar in half as it's a little too sweet. Made it exactly as the recipe says. Would definitely make weekly, maybe only changing the beer. For such a simple recipe, this was really good. I followed the recommendation of someone and I decreased the amount of baking powder. I used about 3.5 tsps. It did not have baking powder taste. Seems like a good recipe. Never had the chance to try it since it will be taken to church on Sunday for the youth bake sale. The crust seemed a bit hard, but I did top it with melted butter to give it a different appearance and flavor. I will make it again and update my review later. Wonderful bread. Did exactly what the recipe said except I did pour 1/2 cup melted butter over top before cooking. Great flavour and the crust is awesome. I'll be making this again soon. used only 3tsp of baking powder and poured 1/4 cup melted butter over the batter as other reviewers suggested, used a stout and it was ridiculously good considering how easy and simple this is! Taste was there. It was just to crumbly for our taste. I wanted to try something that did not require yeast. So for that reason and since it tasted good, it gets 3 stars. This was ok. I didn't have any beer, so I substituted club soda. If I made it again, I'd probably skip the brown sugar and add a tablespoon of honey instead. It was easy to make and filled its purpose, but not sure I'd care to make it again. Too sweet and salty. Just not my taste. This was delicious and the bread was better on day 2!!! I didn't change a thing and it was a real hit with the family (three generations). Yummy! Made it to go with Best Ham and Bean Soup..yum Yummy! Easy and quick. Loved it. Daughter didn't love the beer taste though. Nice loaf, a bit sweet for my taste. I will use less sugar next time. This is a good quick bread recipe. It has a nice taste, especially to eat with a more prominent dish. As many reviewers have pointed out, it is NECESSARY to cover the bread with butter before baking or the bread will come out extremely hard on top and be difficult to cut. made it,, I actually like it,, but I like texture,, I can see where some would have an issue with it,, yes, with soup and such, Ithink it would be very good,, my wife, who is Chinese, thinks its just okay,, to much of a beer taste for her... I plan to share it, see what otjers think, but for me, I will make it again.... Great recipe! Only thing I changed was I baked it for about 40 minutes instead. The bread will be softer. Followed recipe and added the melted butter as others suggested. Used a black  tan beer and it was so good had to put the loaf in the freezer so that I didn't eat it all in 1 sitting! This quick and easy beer bread version is tastier than the all-white flour that I've used before. Don't expect beer bread to be yeast bread texture, though. It is really delicious with corned beef and cabbage or like meals. I have made this several times using dark beer. We love this bread! It was super easy to make and came out pretty darn good. I think it was a bit salty but I'd make it again. Easy fresh loaf of bread is a good thing. This is the best, the only thing I do differently is to just plop the dough onto parchment paper. Many more crunchy bits this way...and you need to adjust the time to approx 40 mins. great quick and easy to put together. I added Chia seeds, flax, hemp and some oats. Perfect for a cold evening with a bowl of soup or as a dipping bread as an app. Thanks!! Just made this recipe and it turned out amazing! Sadly i forgot the salt so the bread turned out to be a bit sweet. Okay, so I made a couple changes. First off, my husband is a brewer (makes his own beer) and we had some left over grain that he had used. So, instead of using a cup and a half of whole wheat flour, I used a cup of the left over grain and mixed it with water, heated it, then let it cool back to room temperature essentially making non-alcoholic beer so to speak. Then I mixed the mixture into the dry ingredients. Secondly, I used 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of the brown sugar. Over all, it turned out amazing! Hmmm... I thought it was lacking flavor and the texture was very dense. But then I followed another reviewer's suggestion to only use 3 tsp of baking powder, so maybe that was why it turned out dense. Also I used a good dark winter seasonal beer, maybe this is better with a cheap watery beer like Bud! Still, not impressed overall. I've now made this twice and each time it has been excellent. I will definitely continue to use this exact recipe. It is delightfully moist - but maybe it's because we keep adding 16 oz. of beer instead of 12 by accident (we just assumed the bottle was the same volume - nope). As per other suggestions, we have been baking with melted butter poured on top. For the last 10 minutes of baking or so, we have been putting honey into the melted butter too. So good! I have made this bread as written and loved it. But this time I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup roasted unsalted sunflower seeds and then used the dough to make drop biscuits, by baking rounded tablespoons onto a cookie sheet and baking at 425 for 13 minutes. Yummmm. Excellent bread! As per some of the reviews, I added 1/4 cup of melted butter to the top of the bread before baking. I also included shredded cheese and reduced the baking soda to 3 teaspoons. Delicious! I ate two huge slices in one sitting :) The bread turned out amazing! It's a bit crumbly, but that's fine, and adds to the texture. Adding some cinnamon and dried fruits or nuts would probably just add to the magnificence of this recipe. Love this recipe! So easy and quick. Perfect to go with a nice hot bowl of soup or a roast. Only change I make is I use 3 cups of Unbleached white flour insisted of half the whole wheat half white Great recipe! I did not have any whole wheat flour so I added all white flour and it turned out fine. I also added only 3 teaspoons baking powder like one reviewer suggested, and I added only about half of the salt called for as well. To offset the bitter taste that some reviewers complained about I added 2 teaspoons white sugar. I used Corona Extra beer which gave it a nice flavor. 10 minutes before it was finished baking I melted 2 tablespoons butter and poured it over the top, everyone loved the salty flavor it gave to the crust. The bread was finished baking in just under an hour. So easy and good! Substituted 1/4 c date sugar for the brown sugar, and cut back salt to 3/4 tsp. Comes together very fast with dough hook in Kitchen Aid mixer - - prep time less than 5 minutes! This is a simple recipe that is almost no fail. The kind of beer you use influences the taste. So good with high quality butter I have made this twice. The first time I thought that it was too sweet (and I love sweets). I used Sam Adams Octoberfest the first time. Made it again today with Corona for dinner with family. Used less brown sugar and used the full amount of baking powder. We all thought that it tasted great. I did not think that it had a bitter aftertaste. Maybe the key is to shake your baking powder before using it, I always do that. Will definitely make for years to come. This is a tasty bread but I will reduce the salt to 1 tsp next time.
Definitely worth making again. I didn't read through all the reviews so I missed the tip to lower the baking powder. Which is probably exactly what I didn't like about this bread - bitter aftertaste. I used Samuel Adams and added butter to the top - it was so easy to put together. I really wanted to like it, but nope. Hubby didn't even like it fresh out of the oven with butter. It was also difficult to cut into slices, something about the odd-shaped crusty top would have it coming apart. I'm going to try again with the lowered baking powder and add some additions other reviewers tried - but as written, I wouldn't make it again. subbed honey for sugar, used all whole wheat, 3 tsps of baking powder, 3/4 tsp salt, added 1/4 cup water since i was using all wheat and melted butter on top before baking. yum! used honey apple shocktop A bit too sweet and dense. The house smelled wonderful while baking. I used all unbleached bread flour and a bottle of Sierra Nevada Oktoberfest. Very hearty with just a hint of sweet, brushed the top lightly with butter. On the advice of another reviewer I did cut the baking powder to 3 teaspoons. Such a easy, quick ,delicious bread! I used a Pumpkin Ale, amazing. I can't wait to try this with different beers. As other suggestions, I use 1 tsp salt and 3 tsp baking powder. Melted honey and butter, basted it before baking than basted a little more 10 minutes before done. Of note, mine cooked in 45 minutes. Watch carefully! Followed recipe exactly (except for adding 1/4 cup melted butter on the top before baking). Excellent served warm, spread with butter. Good with a hearty soup. Will make again. Super easy and great with chili. This is a good hearty bread, which is great with soups and stews. katibird I cannot believe this is a quick bread. Smell while baking is incredible, texture is awesome, and end result is super tasty. All I had was Heineken light, but I can't wait to make this with a Guinness. Mmm. Did add the melted butter, since almost every other reviewer did; probly about 1/4 cup. UPDATE: Made this again, this time a half batch. A half batch is a little too much for my mini loaf pan! Took about 40 minutes to bake. I liked this no-knead bread recipe. It's dense like soda bread or biscuits. Used all all-purpose flour (didn't have any wheat flour and wanted to try this) and I used a Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer. I didn't have a loaf pan, so just formed the dough into a round pile on a baking sheet and it turned out excellent. The beer taste was strong, but good. Thank you for this recipe!! Used splenda brown sugar and pumkick beer, did not add butter, turn out wonderful. Easily one of the best and simplest bread I have ever made. Will be trying all types of beer in it now. This was really easy and turned out well the first time, nice crusty top. As for beer choice: You have to like the beer to like the bread. Ok...this bread is great! Super simple, quick and easy! It also lends itself to any additions you can think of. I used a pale ale micro brew. I also added rosemary and shredded cheddar. Garlic butter on top and it was amazing! It came out hard, heavy, and inedible. Try all white whole wheat flour, worked like a charm. Has anyone tried it in a bread machine? Fantastic! Made it exactly as written using a local Oktoberfest beer. Fabulous taste and texture. We used it as a side for soup and toasted it in the morning for breakfast. Smells wonderful while baking. Thank you! I did not realize that whole wheat flour could spoil. I did notice a funny smell when I measured it, but kept going with this recipe. The resulting bread was so bitter it was inedible. So, word to the wise, check the whole wheat flour before using : if it has a stale, faintly sour smell, toss it! ",1,26.666666666666668

I've been looking for a simple recipe easy enough to make after work for my baby's tea time; this cake turned out great! We love it. I adjusted sugar by half only because it was too sweet for us, we are a low sugar consumption household. Followed all other ingredients and method to a tee and I was not disappointed. Recipe saved, bookmarked, liked, appreciated. Thank you! I thought it was really good. I did add more vanilla some powder milk an extra egg and swapped 1/2cup oil for butter. I made a double batch. It is really sweet, next time I will use less sugar.I also added a little more baking powder Simple and tasty. This time, made a vanilla frosting and it took it to another level. I will be making this often. Very helpful . I like this recipe  I make this cake Its looks very teste  It teste was very nice my brother, mother  my father like this cake THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE Made this cake today it’s awesome!! Love how simple it is yo make its so moist and soft oh my !! Thanks for the recipe ❤️ I love this cake me and my kids had so much fun making it!! For as long as I can remember my sister has only requested coconut cake for her birthday dessert and we are at your 45 now :-) so we've had plenty of coconut cakes, I've used various recipes over the years but I tried this one this year using coconut extract instead of the vanilla, quite a bit more coconut extract actually but nevertheless I left the recipe the same with the exception of using coconut instead of vanilla and adding shredded coconut. She said this was the best recipe ever! The cake was lovely, I followed the directions exactly with the little exceptions and it turned out with a delicious almost type of crust on the top. We do not Frost them, we mix coconut extract with sweetened condensed milk, poke holes in the cakes, add the sweetened condensed milk and shredded coconut and it was just perfect. I realize the variations may affect the legitimacy of my rating in your mind but it was awesome for our purposes and the cake itself just tasted so good. From the beginning, I doubled the recipe, added a touch more vanilla, some salt and cinnamon. Made it as a cake, and it was good. And then I needed more than one. So I broke out my collection of Pyrex custard cups and now I'm feeling very good about it. Friends love them with coffee, I find them best with hot chocolate, or vanilla ice cream. Okay so the only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I had to alter the recipe. I added 2 tsp of baking powder, doubled the milk, and added an extra egg. After that, it was truly delicious. It is a dense cake, but I didn't mind because the flavor was so good. For icing I made a homemade vanilla pudding cool whip icing and made it a mint green color for fun. I would recommend this recipe. This was an easy and delicious recipe. I wanted something sweet so I decided to make it and it was a hit with my hubby and kids. Will definitely be making this cake again. I love this recipe but I add 2 tsp of baking powder. Today I added Blueberries in the batter to make blueberry muffins in my air fryer. Needless to say they are so good I ate 4 of them this morning. Need I say more? Very delicious and extremely easy to make. I'll use this recipe alot Simple and versatile cake that is delicious. I follow recipe exactly except use salted butter. I usually make blueberry or strawberry sauce to put on top. It is good plain as well. I made cupcakes with this recipe  added a few sprinkles into the batter, frosted them, and dipped them in sprinkles to turn them into ""Birthday Cake"" cupcakes. It actually ended up making 13 so I had an extra for my son to taste test. This cake was just as the name stated - simple. I don't know why people were saying it turned out like cornbread - mine turned out moist and delicious just as a cake/cupcake should be. I can only assume people are overmixing the batter and stressing the gluten. Don't overbeat the batter once the flour has been added! I will beat it until it's almost done  then hand mix the last few strokes. I also used softened butter to cream with the sugar. This is definitely a keeper for those of us that prefer white/yellow cake to chocolate. The cake was very good, if you double the milk  add 1 extra egg. Some 'Allrecipes'-members ain't that experienced. Please try more, dear bakers! Ok it was very good but heres the issue I had with it. Following the recipe the batter ended up in a cookie dough consistency so I added water. Looking back I should have added double the milk in the recipe instead. Also it did not rise. Could have been due to my baking power being stale or old. But if anyone else sees their cake tuning out in a lemon bar consistency like mine did, I would consider using a tea spoon more baking powder. Thanks! Really yummy anyway!! Ps very good with cream cheese frosting. Allrecipes has a recipe for that too. I thought it was very good . My husband loved it. I tailored it to our preferences . I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. We don't like too sweet. It was delicious! Thank you! This cake is very dry. I much prefer the work and light n airy chiffon. Maybe it's because I used plant based butter and milk vs dairy based product due to food sensitivities. The girls all liked it:) I'm not usually one to write a review. I have made this recipe three times now and my family loves it but, I think it only is okay. Not that the cake is bad I personally just don't like cake. I have made it exactly like the recipe. I did as one other allrecipe poster did, I used half butter half butter flavored shortening I also used lemon extract and fresh lemon zest in the batter and the frosting. This actually is the second time I am making this cake the first time I followed the recipe to the letter and it was wonderful so this time I just wanted to get a little creative. I love this cake and it is a very economic treat for my household. I also did it in a 9 inch round pan it came out great. Finally found the perfect vanilla cake recipe Followed recipe exactly I was skeptical and I was right to be the cake wouldn't not cook I tried everything to get it to and it stayed mush I turned the heat up and covered the top so it wouldn't burn and even after another hour it wasn't cooking horrible recipe This was the first vanilla cake recipe I've tried out, and now it's the only one I ever bake. Absolutely love this cake, and it's one the easiest and quickest to make. Bake time differs for different tins and depths though- mine took 50 minutes in the oven Very good I halfed everything to make 6 muffins. From beginning to the eat, it only took me 30 minutes. My kids like te muffins so much. Great! Should try again next time w frosting! Easy and good who needs a cake mix? My wife and i decided we want cake. Its just we didn't have any cake mix. And since were on the Navajo Nation the nearest store is about 25 miles away. We had to try this. It came out good. I love this recipe! I usually pair it with a cream cheese icing and it’s delicious! That being said, I have only made cupcakes with this recipe but I will definitely make a cake soon! I recommend this cake to everyone! I followed every step. The only part that did not work was cooking time. It need 75 minutes do cook almost double of the top time. I add some chocolate drops and tasted amazing I’m sure it’s different for others, as I’m horrible at baking and cooking, but it feels like a weird McDonald’s hash brown and it tastes like soggy cereal. It also deflated a lot It's a yellow cake but it's a good solid cake. Changes I made: -1 cup AP flour 1/2 Corn starch. Because there's too much gluten in AP and that's why people are getting ""cornbread."" (Or just use cake flour) -2 eggs and 1 egg yolk. The extra egg yolk adds more emulsifer. -Used Butter milk instead of regular milk. The added acidity reacts well with the baking powder. No changes were made to this recipe. Was simple ,quick ..an delicious this recipe is amazing! ive never had much lake with cake making but this recipe is so easy and it tastes so good. I did make a couple changes just for convenience sake such as adding an extra half a cup of milk to help the batter become smoother and replacing the baking powder with baking soda because i somehow misplaced my baking powder. I made this cake and the results were amazing..its my first tume making a cake and it came out so moist and super tasty..i recommend this to anyone who is starting to learn This made me think of my Mom and her scratch cake ...l love it and I make it all the time so easy Honestly if you are in a mood for a moist fluffy cake dont make this, but if your in a mood for a kinda sweet cornbread than its for you. Maybe add more milk, I might try to soak it in milk but I don't think i can salvage it. I'll follow up if it works. I made the recipe right and everything and my oven almost caught on fire and it bubbled up and everything. I bake a lot. Mostly breads. Im trying to bring my cake skills up. Always a crowd pleaser. Ive been search for a good basic recipe and tried this. Im living in barsil (american) and flour here is kinda tough. You have to sift it evry time. I had to learn to make ""cake flour"" from AP. Simple matter of trading 2 tbsp of AP per cup, for 2tbsp of corn starch. That was the key. I made this cake to experiment and it was perfect. Soft and light and delicious. Didnt frost it till after I tried it. Just whipped cream. Delicious. I will use this a lot. Perfect basic recipe. Instructions were spot on. Thank you. Firstly, the recipe is simple and the cake is tasty. However, I do not recommend this for cupcakes, it’s a very light cake, crumbles easy and doesn’t rise into the typical cupcake muffin top, as shown in the picture. I made these for a strawberry cake (which I need to crumble the cake anyway so that works) and cupcakes for a gender reveal. They’re way too soft to be hollowed out and filled so I will have to make more cupcakes with a different recipe. (Ignore the dent in the cake. My 11 yr old thought he’d be funny and shove his thumb into it 🙄 kids lol) I substituted 3/4 cup milk, 1tsp almond  1 tsp vanilla flavorings  used 1/2 very ripe banana. It was delicious! it is nice and delicious to eat, thank you so much. I made the recipe exactly how it said, and my cake turned out wonderfully. Ty for the recipe. It's so nice, easy and straightforward. The outcome is beautiful. I made two round cakes out of this recipe to make this Easter bunny! It was SO GOOD!! if you just follow the recipe it turns out wonderfully! Huge hit in our family for all the white cake lovers (like me!) Great easy cake recipe, I did add 1/2 cup sour cream and 1 cup chopped strawberries. Moist and delicious. Will always use this recipe and add my own creations. Can’t wait to make pineapple/coconut cake next. i loved it! i was so simple and i already had everything! thanks! I haven't tasted it honestly, but the recipe was easy to make and looks perfect so far! Think we did something wrong, we made bread.. I loved it. Made cake pops out of the batter. wish i could find the picture i took of it. 11 stars out of ten. one hundred percent helpful. great craft for me and my bestie. Little ingredients and delicious 🥰 thank you 😊 easy enough cake to make for an amateur baker. delicious! Came out too dense, more like a cornbread. Flavor was ok. Easy to make, delicious, flavorful, and easy to find ingredients! Thanks! I made it as suggested and love the taste and the simplicity of it❤️ I love it sounded delicious and love it how it looks like. It tasted good and was super fluffy. It wasn’t very sweet but that might just be because I didn’t have frosting. I have made this cake about 10 times I love it so much and it is my go-to recipe to make for my family! It is a delicious recipe and it is great to make with the kids. Quick and simple recipe. I changed a few items with milk to lactose free light, butter to nuttelex and I couldn’t locate baking powder so I included SRF with vanilla based icing. I’ll try cinnamon sugar butter icing next time. Easy and fast! I add lemon extract and some raspberry preserves and it turned out amazing! Great recipe and easy to make. I adjusted the recipe by substituting: 1/2 cup of almond flour to the 1 1/2 all purpose flour and 1 teaspoon of almond extract and 1 tspn of vanilla extract, instead of 2 tspns of vanilla extract. All other ingredients remained the same and cooking time was approximately 30-35 minutes. The cake was light and very flavorful. Served it with fresh strawberries 🍓. Yummy. I actually haven't made this yet. I have some questions or I should say more or less I need ideas. I want to make a rainbow cake and it's going to be made with 8in round pans. I am doing red orange yellow green blue violet. I want to use stuff like strawberries and blueberries for the red and blue and my needed ideas are what can I use for each of the colors and how much do I put in the batter without compromising it? I don't want to use food coloring. Can I use like a strawberry glaze or should I macerate berries and mix them in? And if I need to switch up the actual recipe to add in my color/flavor please let me know that as well. I really don't want to buy flavored boxed cakes. But I will if I have to. That would probably be easier on me because I'm disabled. But I'm willing to try this if I can get some great ideas on how to color my cake batter with something that has flavor to it. So any help you can give I would greatly appreciate and when and if I do make this I will definitely come back and let you know how it turned out. I would like to do it for Easter. And what may happen is I make one or two batters everyday for 3 or 6 days and then stack them and I'm just going to put on whipped cream because my son's not a fan of frosting and maybe some rainbow sprinkles. Thanks in advance for any help and I can't wait to try this. It was really good, family loved it made it 3 times already :) My family has made this cake for over 70 years. My mother made it, and would top each piece with warm fudge sauce. It is not a white cake, as stated. It includes the yolks of the ages, and that makes it a yellow cake. Nice. I added 1/4 cup of oil to make it more moist. I also used baking soda to make it lighter. nice!! This recipe tasted absolutely amazing! I usually use buttermilk with milk, but this is just as good, maybe even better without buttermilk! In my photo I just added food dye and made a zebra cake. We did it it was really dry If i could give this 0 stars i would, it is so bad. It is grainy, yellow and way to sweet. I only could gut it down because of MY buttercream on top. 0/10 do not reccomend. Was easy and tasted good. I needed to add more milk to it bc it was very clumpy I have tried plenty other cake recipes and this is the first time I've baked a perfect cake thanks to this simple white cake recipe ....love it Very easy to prepare and make. I was very impressed. So, i'm generally a pretty good baker, i love to bake, I do it all the time, and in a moment of boredom this morning I decided I'd try a quick easy recipe and picked this recipe at random to bake a cake. my disappointment is immeasurable. I followed all the instructions exactly and it was the most overly-sweet dry cake I have ever made. unless you're feeding it to small children with no concept of what good cake tastes like. Don't bother. I ate half a piece and threw out the entire cake, it was that bad. Honestly, if you are going to attempt this, i'd seriously recommend adding some vegetable oil to the recipe to add moisture to the cake and some salt to balance the sweetness. Made cupcakes and added sprinkles, next time I will put less dough in to see if they stay in the cup. Dough had a great flavor! Will make again. Very delicious 100% would recommend I made this recipe gluten free, and it was amazing! Everyone in my family loved it I loved it. I made for my grandmas birthday and she loved it This was so good and the inside was so soft It was good Needs to have another eighth to quarter cup butter and then perfect - also make sure to double recipe for a full double layer cake Love it easy to make Its honestly soo soo good..Every single time I would bake a cake it would backfire but this one works and it's simple....You should try this Nostalgic!!! The taste brought back some very positive childhood memories me. My very picky child can't stop eating it; win-win situation. I loved it!!! I used gluten-free all purpose flour instead of regular and whipped chocolate icing. AMAZING!! I made two yesterday for and I have one going into the oven in a few minutes. I took one of yesterday’s to a Christmas party last night and everyone loved it. 
The one in the oven is going to Christmas dinner with my son this evening.
What I love about this cake besides it’s amazing flavor and texture, is the fact that the recipe is so simple that I’ve memorized it! And, it always comes out perfect! Great recipe my family absolutely loved it for my aunt's bday!!!! O.M.G.!!!! This is the absolute *best* tasting white cake I believe I've ever had!
It has the perfect amount of sweetness, moistness, and I love the vanilla flavor! I used this recipe to make part of my sister's birthday cake. I had some batter left over, so I made 4 cupcakes, too, and shared them with my family. Everyone absolutely LOVED them, and raved about them! It's so much better than any store bought cake or any boxed cake mix! I don't think I'll ever use any other white cake mix ever again! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I'm going to share it onto my Facebook page called ""The Hearth of Cooking"". Always delightful. Thank you. The taste was too sugary and cake came out dry Love the flavor of this simple cake! Definitely a new favorite! Would be really good with fruit too. It was an amazing tasting cake! This cake recipe is also really good for making cake pops! Cake was fluffy, moist and not too sweet. Directions are easy to follow! Was too dry pretty good Very easy, being ""old and lazy"" lol, I put all the ingredients in the bowl together and beat it for about 5 mts. The cake worked out beautifully and still lovely and moist the day after baking. Tks for the recipe. this cake is incredibly tasty and i'm constantly getting vociferous requests for it. even with the egg yolks, it's still very white inside, making it a good choice for tinting with food colorings. it is a hair on the sweet side, especially with frosting, but it's really just right for a cake like this, and it's a recipe that lends itself well to additions like chocolate chips, marshmallows, or flavoring extracts. when made as cupcakes the batter does have a tendency to spill way over the top of the cups while baking, so i'd probably suggest a jumbo muffin pan instead of a standard one.

Pannukakku (Finnish Oven Pancake),4.0,2.0,"I first ate pannukakku while living in Finland on a religious mission. It tastes something like a mix between a German pancake and custard.

Turned out really good. I have never had a Finnish pancake before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. To me, this turned out more like a magic cake (a cake on top of custard) than anything else. It was good, though. I did use butter in place of margarine, and I would do so again. The flavor was just sweet enough, but rich and buttery. I wonder if making this more like a German pancake (where you melt the butter by placing the pan in the oven as it preheats, then adding the batter to the hot pan) would yield a slightly different result? (i.e. more ""puff""). Regardless, it was something new to try and it was easy to make! Thank you for the recipe! ",0,22.0
